BLM turned me into a conservative.,7625,hk2tia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hk2tia/blm_turned_me_into_a_conservative/,1027,1593744432.0,"I grew up in Northern Illinois my father is black and my mother is white. For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.

When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.

I'm a liberal.

I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

You do stupid shit.. and I think blaming ALL white people and ALL cops for the death of a black man is utter bullshit. The difference it would make if people started thinking logically, would be beautiful.. 
Sending hugs to the good cops, first responders, and everyone else out there affected by everything going on.. I hope someday black people will realize that this is just a setup to keep them from ever advancing in life and having a ‘victim mindset’...

I’m a liberal and I finally quit r/Politics,4107,g9gj64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/g9gj64/im_a_liberal_and_i_finally_quit_rpolitics/,995,1588076859.0,"I like to think I have an open mind. Even if I don’t agree with right-wing politics, I always find myself coming back to this subreddit to see what’s going on. And aside from the occasional Biden meme (which are funny), there’s a lot of good discussion over here.

I cannot stand r/Politics. The ENTIRE purpose of that place is to bash Trump and to bash conservative thoughts. There’s no unbiased conversation. Hell, there’s hardly any sane liberal conversation.

I may not agree with you guys on politics, but at least you guys can produce rational thoughts. I’m so tired of EVERYTHING boiling down to OrAnGe MaN BaD. 
  
Thank you guys for not sucking, that is all

Edit: Thanks for the support folks. I made this post out of frustration before going to bed, and I wake up to this. I think I had like 300 karma before this post, so that’s cool I suppose.

I still don’t like Trump as both a person and a politician, but at least we can be a bit more honest here and have adult conversations. It’s okay to disagree, politics is a matter of values.

And of course, now I’m being attacked by liberals in my DM’s telling me I was never a liberal in the first place. Very classy move liberals, let’s see if it pays off",Conservative,0

The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.,3807,ho9qfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ho9qfp/the_complete_lack_of_response_to_desean_jackson/,423,1594352333.0,"I have always considered myself fairly ""centrist"". While I have  had some conservative leanings, namely support of Israel as a Jew, I have had mostly left-leaning social views. Most recently, this meant that I supported the message of BLM. While I was far from marching in the streets, I accepted their movement and supported their message of equality. However, these last few days have shown me that, at least according to BLM ""leadership"" and prominent black voices, all lives do not, in fact, matter. DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted to social media a quote attributed to Hitler, claiming that Jews are what keep black people ""down"". Now, I know that in every large group, there are a few crazies. I was not about to abandon my support for BLM because of the actions of one man. Then, former NBA player Steven Jackson came out in support of his comments, claiming that Jews are part of a global conspiracy to disenfranchise Black Americans.

He doubled down.

He tripled down.

And you know what the response from the NBA, NFL, and BLM has been?

Silence.

I have seen one response from a current player condemning these hateful comments. Steven A Smith couldn't address the issue on ESPN without saying ""George Floyd"" half a dozen times. The leagues, the players, the media, has said basically nothing about this at all. These are the same people that shrieked at Drew Brees for stating he thought people should stand for the national anthem. Yet, when confronted by an actual racist opinion, because it comes from one of their own, they are completely silent. BLM likes to use the phrase ""silence is violence"" to describe what they view as complicit behavior on the part of those who do not actively campaign for their cause. Yet their own prominent voices have nothing to say about flat out racism, because this time it came from someone they share a skin color with. This has shown me, about as clearly as possible, that they don't actually care about anyone but themselves. Just like the members of any extremist movement, they and their ilk can do no wrong, and if they did, it was ""misinterpreted"". The thin veneer of a desire for equality has been shown as a desire for power and control. The ""left"" has told me for years that I should give special treatment to those that are different from me, because they have struggles I couldn't understand. But, when it comes down to brass tacks, it's clear they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Despite Jews helping the civil rights movement. Despite Jews being founding members of the NAACP. Despite Jews being lynched by the Klan alongside them in the summer of 1964.

I'm not asking for them to get down on their knees and grovel to me for forgiveness. All I've ever wanted out of this situation was a public condemnation. A statement saying ""this is not what we stand for"".  None of these organizations could spare a minute or paragraph to publicly condemn Mr. Jackson. I guess Jews aren't a big enough demographic to spend time pandering to anymore.",Conservative,0

"Liberal here, want to apologize for my side",3544,5ceoir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5ceoir/liberal_here_want_to_apologize_for_my_side/,627,1478902596.0,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. ",Conservative,0

BLM turned me into a conservative.,7624,hk2tia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hk2tia/blm_turned_me_into_a_conservative/,1027,1593744432.0,"I grew up in Northern Illinois my father is black and my mother is white. For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.

When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.

EDIT

Thanks for the comments and medals. I wrote this in a burst of frustration after months of feeling more than a little irritated about BLM. Wish I worded it a bit better, explained somethings, but I'm not going to, thanks guys and gals. I appreciate it.",Conservative,0

I'm a liberal. But I find Reddit's new anti - hate speech policy very dangerous.,5857,hie76j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hie76j/im_a_liberal_but_i_find_reddits_new_anti_hate/,1535,1593512023.0,"I identify more closely with the left, but I spend a lot of time on r/conservative just to hear different perspectives. I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

A warning from a Hong Konger to the USA,4421,ghwu2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ghwu2w/a_warning_from_a_hong_konger_to_the_usa/,506,1589261229.0,"I don’t know whether this post will get a lot of traction or not, but hear me out. I am from Hong Kong and I am here to warn you guys about the dangers of ccp influence on the US politics. 



China is a ruthless, power hungry dictatorship that wants to assert world domination through ways such as political influence, information warfare and economic power. Don’t believe me? Look at Africa and how they need to listen to the whims of ccp because the ccp lends them a lot of money to build infrastructures. As a result the chinese pretty much have full political and economical control as for now. 



What does that have to for the US? Well as you may heard many liberals are still hanging on the the idea of”China is our friend” or “Don’t hate china for the virus!” Truth is if you dont do something against China, they will have more and more political influence in the world and in the end you (no matter liberals/conservatives) will bow to China. Just look at how China has already influenced UK with the 5G networking deals and notice how the UK governent is so scared to say out anything agaist China (eg.the virus). Id say this to the liberals but they seemed to be too occupied with making friends with China and not even relising their freedom of speech they so enjoy will be taken away under China, China will use freedom of speech for its advantage and paint itself a good image. Just look at how many state run medias are broadcasting chinese propoganda on youtube already and how internet army speaks out against freedom fighters in HK and Tibet and of course Taiwan. They also seemed to be too occupied to say that saying out anything against China is RACIST. 


Please, for the love of god be VERY clear a dictatorship like china is your enemy and you should at least try to convince the libs to be wary. And tell them Trump is the first president to really stood up agaist China, just look what obama did to make the evil ccp a world power. Stay vigilant conservatives, we have a common enemy to fight to defend liberty and freedom!

Even if I don’t agree with right-wing politics, I always find myself coming back to this subreddit to see what’s going on. And aside from the occasional Biden meme (which are funny), there’s a lot of good discussion over here.

I cannot stand r/Politics. The ENTIRE purpose of that place is to bash Trump and to bash conservative thoughts. There’s no unbiased conversation. Hell, there’s hardly any sane liberal conversation.

I may not agree with you guys on politics, but at least you guys can produce rational thoughts. I’m so tired of EVERYTHING boiling down to OrAnGe MaN BaD. 
  
Thank you guys for not sucking, that is all

Edit: Thanks for the support folks. I made this post out of frustration before going to bed, and I wake up to this. I think I had like 300 karma before this post, so that’s cool I suppose.

I still don’t like Trump as both a person and a politician, but at least we can be a bit more honest here and have adult conversations. It’s okay to disagree, politics is a matter of values.

And of course, now I’m being attacked by liberals in my DM’s telling me I was never a liberal in the first place. Very classy move liberals, let’s see if it pays off",Conservative,0

The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.,3801,ho9qfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ho9qfp/the_complete_lack_of_response_to_desean_jackson/,423,1594352333.0,"I have always considered myself fairly ""centrist"". While I have  had some conservative leanings, namely support of Israel as a Jew, I have had mostly left-leaning social views. Most recently, this meant that I supported the message of BLM. While I was far from marching in the streets, I accepted their movement and supported their message of equality. However, these last few days have shown me that, at least according to BLM ""leadership"" and prominent black voices, all lives do not, in fact, matter. DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted to social media a quote attributed to Hitler, claiming that Jews are what keep black people ""down"". Now, I know that in every large group, there are a few crazies. I was not about to abandon my support for BLM because of the actions of one man. Then, former NBA player Steven Jackson came out in support of his comments, claiming that Jews are part of a global conspiracy to disenfranchise Black Americans.

He doubled down.

He tripled down.

And you know what the response from the NBA, NFL, and BLM has been?

Silence.

I have seen one response from a current player condemning these hateful comments. Steven A Smith couldn't address the issue on ESPN without saying ""George Floyd"" half a dozen times. The leagues, the players, the media, has said basically nothing about this at all. These are the same people that shrieked at Drew Brees for stating he thought people should stand for the national anthem. Yet, when confronted by an actual racist opinion, because it comes from one of their own, they are completely silent. BLM likes to use the phrase ""silence is violence"" to describe what they view as complicit behavior on the part of those who do not actively campaign for their cause. Yet their own prominent voices have nothing to say about flat out racism, because this time it came from someone they share a skin color with. This has shown me, about as clearly as possible, that they don't actually care about anyone but themselves. Just like the members of any extremist movement, they and their ilk can do no wrong, and if they did, it was ""misinterpreted"". The thin veneer of a desire for equality has been shown as a desire for power and control. The ""left"" has told me for years that I should give special treatment to those that are different from me, because they have struggles I couldn't understand. But, when it comes down to brass tacks, it's clear they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Despite Jews helping the civil rights movement. Despite Jews being founding members of the NAACP. Despite Jews being lynched by the Klan alongside them in the summer of 1964.

I'm not asking for them to get down on their knees and grovel to me for forgiveness. All I've ever wanted out of this situation was a public condemnation. A statement saying ""this is not what we stand for"".  None of these organizations could spare a minute or paragraph to publicly condemn Mr. Jackson. I guess Jews aren't a big enough demographic to spend time pandering to anymore.",Conservative,0

"Liberal here, want to apologize for my side",3543,5ceoir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5ceoir/liberal_here_want_to_apologize_for_my_side/,627,1478902596.0,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. ",Conservative,0

Disqualified in a high school debate for quoting Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson,3393,afrmjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/afrmjd/disqualified_in_a_high_school_debate_for_quoting/,552,1547465698.0,"**Here's a link to the video:** [https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI](https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI)

My partner and I do Policy Debate and recently competed in the Arizona State Invitational debate tournament. The debate topic was ""Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on legal immigration""

In policy debate, the affirmative proposes a plan which falls under the resolution, and the negative rejects it. For example, many affirmatives remove the per-country limits on immigration. My partner and I were assigned the negative position, but our opponents did not read a plan. Instead, they performed a slam poem about citizenship and dehumanization.

In response, we argued that they weren't actually an affirmative because they did not advocate a plan for the resolution, and that their strategy was unfair to negative positions.

They then argued we could not talk about fairness because we were white males and had ""caucasity"".

In response, we read a critique against identity politics utilizing quotes from Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson. We argue that our identity as white males shouldn't matter in the round; that our race and gender have nothing to do with what's right and wrong; That we should instead regard people as individuals. The judge then ends the round and disqualifies for making ""racist and violent"" arguments endorsed by ""white supremacists.""

The debate space is a leftist echo chamber and it must be exposed. I first attempted to bring this to light on [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate), but was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, and the post was eventually removed by the moderators. Hard to imagine a better way for them to prove my point.

BLM turned me into a conservative.,7626,hk2tia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hk2tia/blm_turned_me_into_a_conservative/,1027,1593744432.0,"I grew up in Northern Illinois my father is black and my mother is white. For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.

When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.

I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

You do stupid shit.. and I think blaming ALL white people and ALL cops for the death of a black man is utter bullshit. The difference it would make if people started thinking logically, would be beautiful.. 
Sending hugs to the good cops, first responders, and everyone else out there affected by everything going on.. I hope someday black people will realize that this is just a setup to keep them from ever advancing in life and having a ‘victim mindset’...

First and foremost, we want you to know that you have *always* been welcome in our subreddit. We welcome any and all Conservatives from many walks of life. Even our moderation team is highly diverse! 

For those of you who might be confused as to what’s going on, this morning Reddit banned around 2000 subreddits for “hate speech”, aka wrong think. Among those banned was r/RightWingLGBT. 

But fear not! You are not completely sub-less. We welcome you to find a new home in r/Conservative. Please, make yourself comfortable in our subreddit. You’re family!

As always, we ask all of our users—new, old, and flaired—to follow our rules. Send any and all questions to our mod team via mod-mail. Please and thank you. 

We are so happy you’ve chosen to reddit with r/Conservative. We hope you enjoy your time here!

See you in the sub,

Even if I don’t agree with right-wing politics, I always find myself coming back to this subreddit to see what’s going on. And aside from the occasional Biden meme (which are funny), there’s a lot of good discussion over here.

I cannot stand r/Politics. The ENTIRE purpose of that place is to bash Trump and to bash conservative thoughts. There’s no unbiased conversation. Hell, there’s hardly any sane liberal conversation.

I may not agree with you guys on politics, but at least you guys can produce rational thoughts. I’m so tired of EVERYTHING boiling down to OrAnGe MaN BaD. 
  
Thank you guys for not sucking, that is all

Edit: Thanks for the support folks. I made this post out of frustration before going to bed, and I wake up to this. I think I had like 300 karma before this post, so that’s cool I suppose.

I still don’t like Trump as both a person and a politician, but at least we can be a bit more honest here and have adult conversations. It’s okay to disagree, politics is a matter of values.

And of course, now I’m being attacked by liberals in my DM’s telling me I was never a liberal in the first place. Very classy move liberals, let’s see if it pays off",Conservative,0

The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.,3809,ho9qfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ho9qfp/the_complete_lack_of_response_to_desean_jackson/,423,1594352333.0,"I have always considered myself fairly ""centrist"". While I have  had some conservative leanings, namely support of Israel as a Jew, I have had mostly left-leaning social views. Most recently, this meant that I supported the message of BLM. While I was far from marching in the streets, I accepted their movement and supported their message of equality. However, these last few days have shown me that, at least according to BLM ""leadership"" and prominent black voices, all lives do not, in fact, matter. DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted to social media a quote attributed to Hitler, claiming that Jews are what keep black people ""down"". Now, I know that in every large group, there are a few crazies. I was not about to abandon my support for BLM because of the actions of one man. Then, former NBA player Steven Jackson came out in support of his comments, claiming that Jews are part of a global conspiracy to disenfranchise Black Americans.

He doubled down.

He tripled down.

And you know what the response from the NBA, NFL, and BLM has been?

Silence.

I have seen one response from a current player condemning these hateful comments. Steven A Smith couldn't address the issue on ESPN without saying ""George Floyd"" half a dozen times. The leagues, the players, the media, has said basically nothing about this at all. These are the same people that shrieked at Drew Brees for stating he thought people should stand for the national anthem. Yet, when confronted by an actual racist opinion, because it comes from one of their own, they are completely silent. BLM likes to use the phrase ""silence is violence"" to describe what they view as complicit behavior on the part of those who do not actively campaign for their cause. Yet their own prominent voices have nothing to say about flat out racism, because this time it came from someone they share a skin color with. This has shown me, about as clearly as possible, that they don't actually care about anyone but themselves. Just like the members of any extremist movement, they and their ilk can do no wrong, and if they did, it was ""misinterpreted"". The thin veneer of a desire for equality has been shown as a desire for power and control. The ""left"" has told me for years that I should give special treatment to those that are different from me, because they have struggles I couldn't understand. But, when it comes down to brass tacks, it's clear they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Despite Jews helping the civil rights movement. Despite Jews being founding members of the NAACP. Despite Jews being lynched by the Klan alongside them in the summer of 1964.

I'm not asking for them to get down on their knees and grovel to me for forgiveness. All I've ever wanted out of this situation was a public condemnation. A statement saying ""this is not what we stand for"".  None of these organizations could spare a minute or paragraph to publicly condemn Mr. Jackson. I guess Jews aren't a big enough demographic to spend time pandering to anymore.",Conservative,0

"Liberal here, want to apologize for my side",3545,5ceoir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5ceoir/liberal_here_want_to_apologize_for_my_side/,627,1478902596.0,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. ",Conservative,0

Disqualified in a high school debate for quoting Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson,3388,afrmjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/afrmjd/disqualified_in_a_high_school_debate_for_quoting/,552,1547465698.0,"**Here's a link to the video:** [https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI](https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI)

My partner and I do Policy Debate and recently competed in the Arizona State Invitational debate tournament. The debate topic was ""Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on legal immigration""

In policy debate, the affirmative proposes a plan which falls under the resolution, and the negative rejects it. For example, many affirmatives remove the per-country limits on immigration. My partner and I were assigned the negative position, but our opponents did not read a plan. Instead, they performed a slam poem about citizenship and dehumanization.

In response, we argued that they weren't actually an affirmative because they did not advocate a plan for the resolution, and that their strategy was unfair to negative positions.

They then argued we could not talk about fairness because we were white males and had ""caucasity"".

In response, we read a critique against identity politics utilizing quotes from Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson. We argue that our identity as white males shouldn't matter in the round; that our race and gender have nothing to do with what's right and wrong; That we should instead regard people as individuals. The judge then ends the round and disqualifies for making ""racist and violent"" arguments endorsed by ""white supremacists.""

The debate space is a leftist echo chamber and it must be exposed. I first attempted to bring this to light on [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate), but was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, and the post was eventually removed by the moderators. Hard to imagine a better way for them to prove my point.

BLM turned me into a conservative.,7630,hk2tia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hk2tia/blm_turned_me_into_a_conservative/,1027,1593744432.0,"I grew up in Northern Illinois my father is black and my mother is white. For the longest time I thought I was a liberal. I thought liberals cared about people and were logical, that's not the case in my experience. As soon as George Floyd died any piece of logic the liberal party had left was thrown into the wind. These people don't want to solve problems they want to blame people. My father's dad was a  black man who grew  up in Arkansas, he encountered racism and it never slowed him down, he never used it as an excuse. He was a Korean war veteran and after his duty, he worked and provided for his family. He made enough to buy a house and send my father to private school. He made something for himself during the time when it was hard as a black man to do so.

When I see black people today crying racism,  it mocks my grandfather, my grandmother and every single person who worked to show America that blacks are equal. Now being equal isn't enough. We demand special treatment from the police i.e. Nothing should happen to us if we try to escape arrest because racist cops! Corporations and celebrities treat us like small brain proto-humans who can't take a blackface joke and even the Democratic Presidential nominee feels he can decide who is black or not based on who they vote for in the election. I am so sick of this BS. Black people have it better than ever before, but we continue to play victim and ask for handouts that destroy us. Single parent homes are the number one threat that is tearing the black community apart. No one says this on television no one wants to be viewed as a racist. It's sad. The men  in my life taught me to work for things, to never make excuses and to critically think. If I didn't have them in my life I probably would be marching and living a lie. 73% of black kids are born out of wedlock. Kids need adults in their life to teach them morals and values. People praise single mothers but should we be? These are adults who make decisions and then we as a country have to pay for these decisions not in just taxes, but our societal foundation. We enable single moms to keep having kids, those kids grow up without moral character and they perpetuate the cycle.

I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

You do stupid shit.. and I think blaming ALL white people and ALL cops for the death of a black man is utter bullshit. The difference it would make if people started thinking logically, would be beautiful.. 
Sending hugs to the good cops, first responders, and everyone else out there affected by everything going on.. I hope someday black people will realize that this is just a setup to keep them from ever advancing in life and having a ‘victim mindset’...

A warning from a Hong Konger to the USA,4416,ghwu2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ghwu2w/a_warning_from_a_hong_konger_to_the_usa/,506,1589261229.0,"I don’t know whether this post will get a lot of traction or not, but hear me out. I am from Hong Kong and I am here to warn you guys about the dangers of ccp influence on the US politics. 



China is a ruthless, power hungry dictatorship that wants to assert world domination through ways such as political influence, information warfare and economic power. Don’t believe me? Look at Africa and how they need to listen to the whims of ccp because the ccp lends them a lot of money to build infrastructures. As a result the chinese pretty much have full political and economical control as for now. 



What does that have to for the US? Well as you may heard many liberals are still hanging on the the idea of”China is our friend” or “Don’t hate china for the virus!” Truth is if you dont do something against China, they will have more and more political influence in the world and in the end you (no matter liberals/conservatives) will bow to China. Just look at how China has already influenced UK with the 5G networking deals and notice how the UK governent is so scared to say out anything agaist China (eg.the virus). Id say this to the liberals but they seemed to be too occupied with making friends with China and not even relising their freedom of speech they so enjoy will be taken away under China, China will use freedom of speech for its advantage and paint itself a good image. Just look at how many state run medias are broadcasting chinese propoganda on youtube already and how internet army speaks out against freedom fighters in HK and Tibet and of course Taiwan. They also seemed to be too occupied to say that saying out anything against China is RACIST. 


Please, for the love of god be VERY clear a dictatorship like china is your enemy and you should at least try to convince the libs to be wary. And tell them Trump is the first president to really stood up agaist China, just look what obama did to make the evil ccp a world power. Stay vigilant conservatives, we have a common enemy to fight to defend liberty and freedom!

I’m a liberal and I finally quit r/Politics,4104,g9gj64,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/g9gj64/im_a_liberal_and_i_finally_quit_rpolitics/,995,1588076859.0,"I like to think I have an open mind. Even if I don’t agree with right-wing politics, I always find myself coming back to this subreddit to see what’s going on. And aside from the occasional Biden meme (which are funny), there’s a lot of good discussion over here.

I cannot stand r/Politics. The ENTIRE purpose of that place is to bash Trump and to bash conservative thoughts. There’s no unbiased conversation. Hell, there’s hardly any sane liberal conversation.

I may not agree with you guys on politics, but at least you guys can produce rational thoughts. I’m so tired of EVERYTHING boiling down to OrAnGe MaN BaD. 
  
Thank you guys for not sucking, that is all

Edit: Thanks for the support folks. I made this post out of frustration before going to bed, and I wake up to this. I think I had like 300 karma before this post, so that’s cool I suppose.

I still don’t like Trump as both a person and a politician, but at least we can be a bit more honest here and have adult conversations. It’s okay to disagree, politics is a matter of values.

And of course, now I’m being attacked by liberals in my DM’s telling me I was never a liberal in the first place. Very classy move liberals, let’s see if it pays off",Conservative,0

The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.,3803,ho9qfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ho9qfp/the_complete_lack_of_response_to_desean_jackson/,423,1594352333.0,"I have always considered myself fairly ""centrist"". While I have  had some conservative leanings, namely support of Israel as a Jew, I have had mostly left-leaning social views. Most recently, this meant that I supported the message of BLM. While I was far from marching in the streets, I accepted their movement and supported their message of equality. However, these last few days have shown me that, at least according to BLM ""leadership"" and prominent black voices, all lives do not, in fact, matter. DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted to social media a quote attributed to Hitler, claiming that Jews are what keep black people ""down"". Now, I know that in every large group, there are a few crazies. I was not about to abandon my support for BLM because of the actions of one man. Then, former NBA player Steven Jackson came out in support of his comments, claiming that Jews are part of a global conspiracy to disenfranchise Black Americans.

He doubled down.

He tripled down.

And you know what the response from the NBA, NFL, and BLM has been?

Silence.

I have seen one response from a current player condemning these hateful comments. Steven A Smith couldn't address the issue on ESPN without saying ""George Floyd"" half a dozen times. The leagues, the players, the media, has said basically nothing about this at all. These are the same people that shrieked at Drew Brees for stating he thought people should stand for the national anthem. Yet, when confronted by an actual racist opinion, because it comes from one of their own, they are completely silent. BLM likes to use the phrase ""silence is violence"" to describe what they view as complicit behavior on the part of those who do not actively campaign for their cause. Yet their own prominent voices have nothing to say about flat out racism, because this time it came from someone they share a skin color with. This has shown me, about as clearly as possible, that they don't actually care about anyone but themselves. Just like the members of any extremist movement, they and their ilk can do no wrong, and if they did, it was ""misinterpreted"". The thin veneer of a desire for equality has been shown as a desire for power and control. The ""left"" has told me for years that I should give special treatment to those that are different from me, because they have struggles I couldn't understand. But, when it comes down to brass tacks, it's clear they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Despite Jews helping the civil rights movement. Despite Jews being founding members of the NAACP. Despite Jews being lynched by the Klan alongside them in the summer of 1964.

I'm not asking for them to get down on their knees and grovel to me for forgiveness. All I've ever wanted out of this situation was a public condemnation. A statement saying ""this is not what we stand for"".  None of these organizations could spare a minute or paragraph to publicly condemn Mr. Jackson. I guess Jews aren't a big enough demographic to spend time pandering to anymore.",Conservative,0

"Liberal here, want to apologize for my side",3547,5ceoir,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/5ceoir/liberal_here_want_to_apologize_for_my_side/,627,1478902596.0,"EDIT: OK, the title was incorrect
I called myself a liberal. That is true, but I guess I should correct that to ""somewhat left of centre, but not very far out"". I guess I should just stick with ""these are my ideas. I have agreed with the Liberal party of Canada for most of my life, hence I call myself a liberal"". 

  I made this post because, as much as I disagree with the conservative ideology, I don't hate conservative people. And I want to show that the perception that no liberal can maintain a civilized ideological disagreement while not bashing the people who disagree with them is wrong. I do not mean to force my views on you.

1) I want to apologize for the SJWs. I disagree with their ideology entirely, and hope to keep it out of the Canadian government.

2) I do still disagree with many conservative points, but I don't hate conservatives as people. So this post doesn't mean that I am now a conservative - rather, it means that I am disillusioned with what ""liberal"" means today.

3) I hope that, even though we disagree on many topics, we can come together as a common people.

 I will not lie - I had initially hoped for a Hillary presidency. As time went on, however, I decided that I liked neither candidate. But I am going to wait and see what Trump does, instead of immediately denouncing him.

What I am for
---------------
1) Equal rights for all, regardless of skin colour, race, religion, etc.

2) Freedom of speech. Even speech which I don't like.

3) Peaceful protest.

4) Freedom of religion. But subject to restrictions to maintain human rights. Eg. I don't care if you choose to wear a cross or a bindi or a yamuka or etc. out of choice, because of your religion. But I don't think that any religion's values should be forced on nonbelievers.

What I am against
--------------------
1) Division into groups. Everyone should have equal rights. And while I think everyone should be able to be proud of their heritage, I think that, as with many other things, there is an acceptable limit. I.e., you shouldn't go around saying you are better than everyone else because of your heritage.

2) Separation and echo chambers. I have to admit, I was guilty of this. I am now trying to make amends. I think that this has happened on both sides. 

3) Forcing your views on others.

I don't know what ""liberal"" and ""conservative"" will mean in the future. I just want to apologize for SJWs and say that, even though we may disagree ideologically, I hope that we can work together in the future.

I understand that you will disagree with some, or even all, of what I said. I think that's fine. Disagreement is healthy for discourse, and as long as it remains civil, I have no problem with it.

I apologize if this comes across as posting in a sub where I shouldn't post. But I wanted to step out of the echo chamber.

EDIT: Some rebuttals: 

1) No, I am not and never will be a conservative. I don't mind conservative people, but I am not a conservative. I am for a fully secular government, I want more liberal economic policies such as stimulus packages, etc. 

2) I do not mean to say that I disagree with all of the left. I was concerned that the protestors would make me look bad. I simply wanted to point out that I do not condone violence. Peaceful protest is perfectly acceptable. 

3) As my friends have pointed out to me, the electoral college exists for a reason. While I am sad that Hillary lost (although TBH, even though I preferred her to Trump, I was beginning to be unsure), I don't want to get involved in contesting a presidential victory. 

4) I do not want a fully liberal or a fully conservative government. I want a coalition or a centrist government, to prevent extremists on either side from setting policy. 

5) I acknowledge that by listening to only a few news sources, I was not being open minded. But I think that people on both sides were doing this. 

6) I support choice. I want people to have the freedom to do whatever they want, with reasonable limits. You and I disagree on the definiton of ""reasonable"", as shown by some comments below. This includes abortion. Disagreement is fine, but I strongly value this. 

7) As others have pointed out, I cannot claim to speak for all liberals. That was a mistake.

So no, I am not, and will never will be a conservative. I know that many of you will disagree with this, which as I said earlier, is perfectly fine. That was the main point of this post, one that got lost among my inept writing. ",Conservative,0

Disqualified in a high school debate for quoting Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson,3385,afrmjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/afrmjd/disqualified_in_a_high_school_debate_for_quoting/,552,1547465698.0,"**Here's a link to the video:** [https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI](https://youtu.be/8IIm2an8QkI)

My partner and I do Policy Debate and recently competed in the Arizona State Invitational debate tournament. The debate topic was ""Resolved: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce restrictions on legal immigration""

In policy debate, the affirmative proposes a plan which falls under the resolution, and the negative rejects it. For example, many affirmatives remove the per-country limits on immigration. My partner and I were assigned the negative position, but our opponents did not read a plan. Instead, they performed a slam poem about citizenship and dehumanization.

In response, we argued that they weren't actually an affirmative because they did not advocate a plan for the resolution, and that their strategy was unfair to negative positions.

They then argued we could not talk about fairness because we were white males and had ""caucasity"".

In response, we read a critique against identity politics utilizing quotes from Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson. We argue that our identity as white males shouldn't matter in the round; that our race and gender have nothing to do with what's right and wrong; That we should instead regard people as individuals. The judge then ends the round and disqualifies for making ""racist and violent"" arguments endorsed by ""white supremacists.""

The debate space is a leftist echo chamber and it must be exposed. I first attempted to bring this to light on [r/debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/debate), but was met with an overwhelmingly negative response, and the post was eventually removed by the moderators. Hard to imagine a better way for them to prove my point.
