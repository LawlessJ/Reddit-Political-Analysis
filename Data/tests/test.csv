And it makes that blanket statement without any context, while completely denying the mountain of blatant evidence that there was, in fact, wrongdoing by the Bidens. Criminal wrongdoing, even.

They would be incorrect, firstly because there is no right to commit homicide, no matter your gender; and secondly because abortion could still be legal anyways.\n\nAgain, they would be incorrect, but that would be a good example.\n\nBut, no, Trump is not the man who will end gay ""marriage"" :(', 'Exactly, and the media constantly twists his words to fit their narrative. Like when they try to say Trump called white supremacists “very fine people” even though the literal sentence before he said “im not talking about white supremacists because they should be condemned completely”. It’s manipulation, repeat something over and over again until people believe it & vote for your side because they feel like it’s the “right thing”', 'I think your comment hits on another issue, that won’t be as popular in this thread, in that Trump has been president for four years (two of those with complete control of the government) and while you are correct that we really haven’t backtracked on policy, we haven’t moved forward either. Largely, from a policy standpoint, 2016-2018 and 2016-2020 as a whole has been a waste. \n\nSure, you can’t point to things that have occurred via executive order, but that isn’t really policy change because it can all be undone by the next president. From a policy standpoint, this administration has largely been a failure.

And even their core audience, the shrieking leftists, will be tired of TDS, because there won\'t be another election to fight him in.\n\nSo these never-Trumpers\' never-Trumpism won\'t get them very far after the election.

Bolton was able to highlight exactly what Trump did wrong during his time in the White House.  \n\nMy biggest complaint about Trump is his foreign policy.  Alienating allies instead of joining together with them to combat our mutual adversaries was a mistake.  His domestic policy points have not been a huge concern for me though.  My second biggest complaint is that, instead of coherently speaking to calm people down when sensationalist dialog in the media had people's fears heightened, he intentionally enraged them - and I fear we are going to have a massive blue wave in two weeks that will be an absolute disaster for the country as a result.\n\nEdit: If I'm right about that blue wave, it's 100% Trump's fault.

The First Step Act’s reforms addressed inequities in sentencing laws that disproportionately harmed Black Americans and reformed mandatory minimums that created unfair outcomes. The First Step Act expanded judicial discretion in the sentencing of non-violent crimes.  Over 90% of those benefitting from the retroactive sentencing reductions in the First Step Act are Black Americans. Freeing 90,000 Black Americans.  The First Step Act provides rehabilitative programs to inmates, helping them successfully rejoin society and not return to crime. \n\nTrump increased funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by more than 14%. It also made it so they didn't have to come back to DC every year and beg for funding.  Trump signed legislation forgiving Hurricane Katrina debt that threatened HBCUs. \n\nNew single-family home sales are up 31.6% in October 2019 compared to just one year ago. \n\nTrump received the Bipartisan Justice Award at a historically black college for his criminal justice reform accomplishments. \n\nThe poverty rate fell to a 17-year low of 11.8% under the Trump administration as a result of a jobs-rich environment.

Trump ordered Ric Grenell, his openly gay ambassador to Germany, to lead a global initiative to decriminalize homosexuality across the globe. \n\nThrough Trump’s Anti-Trafficking Coordination Team (ACTeam) initiative, Federal law enforcement more than doubled convictions of human traffickers and increased the number of defendants charged by 75% in ACTeam districts. In 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) dismantled an organization that was the internet’s leading source of prostitution-related advertisements resulting in sex trafficking. Trump’s OMB published new anti-trafficking guidance for government procurement officials to more effectively combat human trafficking. Trump’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations arrested 1,588 criminals associated with Human Trafficking. Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services provided funding to support the National Human Trafficking Hotline to identify perpetrators and give victims the help they need. The hotline identified 16,862 potential human trafficking cases. Trump’s DOJ provided grants to organizations that support human trafficking victims – serving nearly 9,000 cases from July 1, 2017, to June 30, 2018. The Department of Homeland Security has hired more victim assistance specialists, helping victims get resources and support. \n\nPresident Trump has called on Congress to pass school choice legislation so that no child is trapped in a failing school because of his or her zip code.

Finalized new trade agreement with South Korea. \n\nMade a deal with the European Union to increase U.S. energy exports to Europe. Withdrew the U.S. from the job-killing TPP deal. Secured $250 billion in new trade and investment deals in China and $12 billion in Vietnam. \n\nOkayed up to $12 billion in aid for farmers affected by unfair trade retaliation. \n\nHas had over a dozen US hostages freed, including those Obama could not get freed. \n\nTrump signed the Music Modernization Act, the biggest change to copyright law in decades. \n\nTrump secured Billions that will fund the building of a wall at our southern border. \n\n The Trump Administration is promoting second chance hiring to give former inmates the opportunity to live crime-free lives and find meaningful employment.

Or do you want to argue with a psychiatric RN of well over a decade thats spent more hours with suicidal people than you\'ll spend doing anything besides maybe trolling the internet?\n\nAnd finally, if you cant see the problem with this, you are the problem. EVERY life is a gift from God, whether is at the very beginning or decades of life down the road and we have no ""right"" to throw that gift in the trash.', 'Well I don’t believe in your god. So if that’s the basis for your argument I don’t think we can continue since we can’t even agree on basic definitions. But have a good day.']",nationalreview.com

Its not the fucking plague"", ""You claim what I said is blatantly false and yet didn't point out anything I said as wrong. In no way is China doing better than the US. Do you believe that there are only 90,000 cases and only 5000 deaths in China? The communist regime doesn't test and trace, they test and lock you down, via welding your doors shut. You also believe Iran is properly testing and recording data as well? I am sure the Mullah terrorists are open about how there country is performing also. India has been in a massive shutdown but still have over 7 million cases and 100,000 deaths. None of these countries have the testing capabilities the US did. The US is going to have more cases when they test more people than every other country. \n\nAlso, based on your diction, it seems like you might not be from the US so I'll explain how our politics works. In the US, there is a federalist system of power. The system has 3 layers of government. There is a local, state and federal. With this system in place, the local government has more power and control over their constituents than the state level, and the state has more power and control over their constituents than the federal level. With that in mind, the states with the worst per capita deaths and cases are Blue Democratic states. Not the Red Republican led states. The majority of the deaths are due to terrible policy pushed by Democrats in charge, like Governor Andrew Cuomo forcing nursing home patients who tested positive for Covid back into nursing homes. Blaming Trump for everything wrong in terms of covid in the US is ignorant at best. Could he have done better, maybe. The simple fact is Biden is proposing the same policy standards Trump has enacted as President except with a nationwide mask mandate.\n\nAlso, the WHO has come around and said shutdowns are not good policy to use. Why do you think it's good for Europe to go back into a shutdown. Do you not believe in the science?"", 'Sure, lots of Americans have poor health and hygiene habits. Many are very obese. That is their own fault. For some reason lots of Americans think the world should shut down instead of hitting a treadmill and actually taking care of their own health. I think this is partially to blame for the higher hospitalization rate compared to other nations.\n\nPersonally I think some of the pushback against masks is pretty overblown, but the government should not have the power to decide who stays open, who must close, mom and pop\'s business gets screwed while walmart makes billions. Deaths of despair rise in the meantime. A blunt shutdown will only destroy the economy again and make people even more resentful.

(Though admittedly a couple are opinion pieces.) There is contradicting evidence and the result is like a Rorschach test, you’ll see what you want. \n\nMy personal view is that the article I previously linked was right, that’s It’s a fool’s errand to claim to know what the CCP wants, bc they have intentionally stayed reticent. I also tend to agree that the CCP benefitted dramatically from Trump, through his destruction of western leverage (loss of alliances) and weakening of US might thru massive debt, internal discord, and inefficient trade war that pretty much all economists have blasted. But I am obviously biased and won’t pretend to know an entire nation’s policy which has been intentionally obscured. \n\n\nAtlantic: [Why China Wants Trump To Win](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/07/why-china-wants-donald-trump-win/613864/)\n\n\nBBC: [US election 2020: Who do Russia, China and Iran want to win?](https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54293489)\n\n\nMarketwatch: [Why China is rooting for Trump to win: The president has diminished America’s power and standing in the world](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-china-is-rooting-for-trump-to-win-11596656684)\n\nBusiness Insider: [Chinese officials want Trump to win reelection because he is 'destroying US alliances' and won't unite to fight Beijing](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-wants-trump-win-election-keep-destroying-us-alliances-bloomberg-2020-6)\n\nForeign Policy: [Trump Is Beijing’s Best Asset Chinese officials want the U.S. president reelected—because he’s so weak. ](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/10/15/china-trump-trump2020-deal-beijing-best-asset/)""]",i.redd.it

Meanwhile the polls underestimated Clinton's support in CA by 7, Hawaii by 8, and DC by 15.\n\nIf you look at all 56 states and districts, only 19 of them were within the 3% margin of error (I am basing my polling averages on 538's final forecast). That's a record of 19 wins and 37 losses, not what I would call a success.\n\nHave pollsters corrected the issues of 2016? I don't think so, at least not enough to be trustworthy.

This was not the case in 2016 unless you exclude the midwest, where errors were correlated, and thus not randomly distributed.\n\nThis is what makes a poll accurate, not a high hit % within the MOE.', 'Yeah, early voting stats are already showing how off these polls are, lol.', 'I do not think that, I simply think a lot of things changed over the course of four years.\nIf you compare the two obama runs, he also had worse values in his second run.\n\nThe polls in 2016 were not accurate because so many third and undecided voters.

The shit is intentional.', 'Funny thing, it just makes me think how much more fun the smug to crying videos are going to be this time around if Trump wins again.', 'I think you are missing my point. It\'s not about getting the ""right answer"" in terms of who would win, I am talking about how close did they come to the final result. If a pollster says a certain candidate is polling at 51% and they actually win with 60%, that\'s not a polling win, that\'s actually waaaay outside the margin of error.\n\nWe saw some pretty extreme examples in 2016 that nobody seemed to notice because the ""right"" party won the state. But look at Tennessee, Trump was predicted to win by 12% but he actually won by 26%. Upper Maine was predicted to be a toss-up (D+.3% according to 538) but Trump actually won by 10 points. And big polling misses happened the other way too. California was predicted to go for Hillary by 23% but she actually won by 31%.\n\nBut because the polling errors went in opposite directions for different states, people can pretend the polling was not too bad because they average all the errors together: Hillary was predicted to win the popular vote by 3-4% and she actually won by 2%. Not the bad, eh? That\'s like a guy who shoots at a target, misses wide left and wide right, then proclaims he has averaged two bullseyes! We don\'t have 1 presidential election in the fall, we have 51 presidential elections. You can\'t average all your mistakes together and think you did well for averaging near the mark. An NFL kicker who misses to the left and then misses to the right has scored 0 points, not 6.\n\nNow it\'s true that the polling was a lot better in 2018 than it was in 2016. But in a lot of crucial states they really missed the mark. \n\nI\'m not saying a Trump win in 2020 is guaranteed. I\'m saying that I don\'t trust these polls. If they said Biden was up 4 or 5 points nationally, I could believe that. But these polls that say he\'s up by 10 or even 14, no way. Biden is not going to outdo Obama\'s historic win of 2008.

Yes, sometimes wider margins will still be close to the average, and sometimes tighter margins will be farther off. on average, this won’t be the case. Isolated observations mean nothing.\n\nAgain, adherence to the average isn’t what makes a poll accurate. What makes a poll accurate is what I described already, randomly distributed errors with a little less than 2/3 being within the margin.', 'These petulant tw*ts will certainly be doing more than crying this time around with the cops neutered.

That's how much they'll be swept up in the moment."", 'The definition of statistical accuracy isn’t a subjective matter, nor is it up for debate.\n\nYou don’t see the value in it because you don’t  understand what randomly distributed errors means.. that on average, the errors will cancel each other out, so this makes the poll accurate on average, which is what matters to predicting an election outcome, not getting super close in every single state poll. looking at individual misses is completely pointless when the big picture is what matters.\n\nThe problem in 2016 was correlated errors in the midwest, an unusually high number of undecideds that polls can’t predict because they by definition can’t be polled accurately, and the comey letter who’s impact couldn’t be digested. None of that is an issue this time around.', 'lol. That’s the best part. \n\nIt’s just an an idea! (With highly organized gatherings)', 'In October 2016 nobody was talking about correlated errors in the Midwest or whatever. A few people were cautioning ""there might be errors we can\'t know about"" but mostly people were trusting the polls. New York Times: 85% for Clinton to win. Huffington Post: 98%. Predictwise: 89% Daily Kos: 92%. Princeton Election Consortium: >99% (yes, really). There was even a hilarious moment where a liberal pundit had a Twitter fight with Nate Silver, accusing him of biasing the 538 model in Trump\'s favor even though 538 only gave Trump a 29% chance to win.\n\nIn November 2020 (or maybe December, depending on how long this takes) there\'s going to be a big list of other things that made this election different that we couldn\'t have known about. Maybe it won\'t be the white non-college vote, maybe it will. But there\'s always going to be something.\n\nI have compiled polling averages going back to 2014, some are better than others but none of them are consistently good.', 'You’re dead wrong on that point. The reason 538 gave such a higher chance to win than everyone else is because in their models, they do in fact account for the possibility of correlated errors based on demographics when they run their simulations, because they know their shit. That is exactly what Nate silver was talking about in 2016 when people were arguing with him. Based on the polls alone, without considering possibility of correlated errors, his 30% chance for trump WAS insane, but he considers the possibility of correlated errors. Your failure to read past the allowed characters on twitter doesn’t change that.\n\nPundits and reporting were exceptionally terrible that year, I’m not defending them. I’m defending the polls and not the media spin. My view on the impending electoral bloodbath is based only on polls and not on any pundits shitty opinion of them.\n\nIs another systemic sampling error possible? Yes. Can lightning strike twice? Yes. Is it likely? No. \n\nEven with the error corrections from last time, and accounting for possible new errors, 538 is still giving a 12% chance for trump last I checked. Biden has a better shot of going over 400 electoral votes than trump does of winning.\n\nFor the last time, the sampling error alone was not enough to give trump the win. Even with it, he would have lost without the high number of undecideds that don’t exist this time around and the comey letter which isn’t going to repeat itself no matter how many hard drives Rudy Giuliani has up his sleeve.\n\nThe 3% margin of error number comes from historic polls compared to their outcome, Your lack of ability to accurately interpret data not withstanding. Your misplaced confidence in your statistics knowledge despite a clear lack of understanding or education in it doesn’t somehow make you right.', 'Statistics might account for random errors, but the problem I\'m talking about is when the polls are wrong, they tend to be ALL wrong. Some of these races are very heavily polled, and none of the pollsters come close to being within the margin of error. That tells me the model is wrong.\n\nLook at this one: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-midterm-election-forecast/senate/indiana/\n\nAll the polls in the last couple weeks of the election range from D+7 to R+3.6, averaging around D+3. The actual result was R+5.9. That\'s not a ""margin of error"" problem, that\'s not a legit random statistical expectation, that\'s the model of the pollsters incorrectly assuming how different demographics are going to vote and who is going to turn up. Multiple polling orgs: Fox News, Harris, Marist, Cygnal, YouGov, they all were outside the margin of error. Even the ""outliers"" for this race were way off.\n\nTwo years after the failure of 2016, they still haven\'t learned how to poll Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Ohio, and other states. Why do you think they have fixed the correlated errors of the Midwest? I see no evidence for that assumption.\n\nIn 2014, Joni Ernst was predicted to win the Iowa senate seat by 1.5 She actually won by 8.3. In 2016, Trump was predicted to win Iowa by 2.9. He actually won by 9.4\n\nToday, in 2020, Trump is predicted (by the polls, averaged by 538) to win Iowa by 0.3%. Ernst is up for re-election; she is predicted to lose by 1.0%. So the polls say these races are toss-ups, within the margin of error.\n\nWhat evidence do you have to believe the pollsters have fixed their Iowa models?\n\nLet\'s check back in a few weeks and see. Maybe you\'re right and the polls will be fine. In that case I will admit I didn\'t understand statistics and I was wrong. But what if Trump and Ernst win Iowa by more than the margin of error? What if it\'s much more? Will you admit your faith in the polls was misplaced?', 'I’m not rehashing the errors in your reasoning again.. your entirely uninformed opinion of a statistical model you don’t come close to understanding carries 0 weight. So does cherry picking data, as already covered.\n\nThe proof of them correcting their sampling error is that every pollster went back and reweighted their samples to account for education and the polls got much more accurate. \n\nTheir is nothing wrong with the model in Iowa, and their never was, and no unique systemic issue has ever been noted in Iowa when it comes to polling besides the issues with uneducated white voters. There was a sampling problem, that’s been fixed. You are using terms you simply do not understand.\n\nIowa May still end up outside of the margin of error, or it may be within, that’s the nature of the beast, it does not matter to the accuracy of polls overall. The fact that you’re even posing this question in this way demonstrates how little you know about statistics. \n\nMy faith in polls will have been misplaced if in the post Mortem analysis, some systemic issue in polling is discovered that hasn’t been discovered before. What happens in Iowa alone is legitimately meaningless to that determination. Even if Iowa is dead on the average, that could still be the case, likewise, if Iowa is off by 10 points that might not be the case.', '> There was a sampling problem, that’s been fixed.\n\nHow do you know it\'s been fixed? Sure, it\'s been changed. But has it been changed correctly? What elections have taken place since the pollsters changed their sample to demonstrate that they are doing it correctly now?\n\nAnd if there was a sampling problem in 2014, why wasn\'t it fixed in 2016? And why wasn\'t it fixed in 2018? Why would you trust the same people who didn\'t fix anything in the last 2 elections when they assure us that this time they actually fixed it?\n\n>My faith in polls will have been misplaced if in the post Mortem analysis, some systemic issue in polling is discovered that hasn’t been discovered before.

I say if your process doesn\'t produce good results, it\'s not a trustworthy process. Reminds me of an old joke, ""But Herr Professor, the facts don\'t agree with your theory! // All the worse for the facts!""', 'Literally just told you how it was fixed. They have accurate demographics they can use to weight their samples, which they backtested. Granted, I know these words mean nothing to you as they fly right over your head so this is a waste of time.\n\nThey’ve done the mid terms since then, which despite your uninformed insistence on cherry picking random data, was one of the most accurate elections for polls of all time. The biggest issue with the midterms was actually that polls were TOO correct, which implies something might actually be off as with random errors you expect to be wrong a certain amount. You just don’t understand how to actually interpret statistics. You prefer to cherry pick data that supports the view that helps you cope with the reality of the impending election.', '>They have accurate demographics they can use to weight their samples, which they backtested.\n\nIf it\'s that simple, why did nobody do it in 2016? Only a couple of polling orgs said Trump was going to win, dozens said he was losing big in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n> They’ve done the mid terms since then, which despite your uninformed insistence on cherry picking random data, was one of the most accurate elections for polls of all time.\n\nIf that\'s one of the most accurate of all time, it\'s a pretty low bar. Less than half of the predictions within the margin of error is considered an amazing success?\n\nMeanwhile, I checked on your claim that polls with bigger margins are expected to have bigger margins of error. Found a recent one here  https://www.news9.com/story/5f90b311788f4939f00759e5/news-9news-on-6-exclusive-poll:-inhofe-leads-broyles-by-20-points-in-us-senate-race that shows the incumbent with a huge lead, but the MoE is stated to be plus or minus 1.32%. I guess you know better than SoonerPoll.com, maybe you should write to them and explain that the MoE is actually much larger.\n\nHere\'s another one by a different pollster: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2020/Mason_Dixon_Kentucky_October_20,_2020.pdf. They say that the MoE is plus or minus 4%, even though the margin of the poll is 17%. Furthermore, they go on to say that ""according to standards customarily used by statisticians"" there is a 95% chance that the actual result is within that 4-point margin of error (actually 8 points if you include the plus and the minus).\n\nYou might say it doesn\'t matter because KY is a shoe-in for Trump anyway. But the polling org themselves note that Trump carried KY by 30 points last time. The implication is that Trump is running 13±4 points behind his result in 2016. And this is the kind of thing that 538 uses to calibrate their predictions for places demographically similar to KY.\n\nNow maybe that poll is correct. Maybe Trump is winning KY by only 9 instead of 30, and he\'s going to get walloped in the general election. But if he wins KY by more than 17, that is something that is supposed to have only a 5% chance of happening! And when he overperforms in multiple states well outside the margin of error, I can\'t believe it\'s a 5% chance for each of those to happen. If only 5% of the polls were outside the MoE, fine. That\'s what they told us to expect. But when there\'s ~50% of the polls outside the MoE, it\'s a BIG problem with the polling. I don\'t care if you call it a sample or a model, it means the polls were untrustworthy.\n\nAnd I hold them just as accountable when a Democrat overperforms their polls outside of the MoE. It should happen only 1 poll in 20, not in half or more. This is why I do not say that Trump is guaranteed to win, only that I do not trust the polls.\n\nGranted there are a couple weeks left and maybe a newer poll of KY will be released that shows a different number. We will see.', 'Again, your lack of understanding on a subject matter doesn’t somehow make you right. \n\nYou don’t know what a Margin of error is or how to interpret it or how to apply it, but you consistently talk about it as though you do.\n\nPolls called the winner in 98% of races in the midterms and 90% of close races. Yes, that is a huge success considering there were over 500 races. And if you look at the data correctly, the margin of error was 3% (not that you know what that means), and the errors were randomly distributed.\n\nThis weird phenomenon amongst conservatives where they feel uninformed layman opinions are as valuable as expert opinions speaks volumes about why the party is in shambles and none of them seem to realize it.\n\nRe margin of error, There is the historic average margin of error, which is roughly 3% for close races, and much wider, historically for not close races. These are based on predictions vs outcomes after the fact. \n\nThen there is another margin of error calculated based on sample size and polling data prior to the outcome.  This is something completely different provides a feel for data quality that will fly over a layman’s head and is part of why layman opinions aren’t worth anything. Though anyone with basic reasoning can spend 4 minutes figuring out that clearly after the fact margins aren’t the same as sample margins.\n\nIn this particular poll, they’ve conducted “the largest state wide poll of all time”, which infers high data quality, hence a low margin of error. This doesn’t change the historic margin of error nor will it change the true error calculated after the fact. \n\nThe reason margins are typically higher in not close races is quite obvious, we don’t generally poll as much because it’s a waste of resources when everyone knows who will win. Less data means bigger errors.', '> Polls called the winner in 98% of races in the midterms and 90% of close races.\n\nIncumbents won 91% of the races in 2018 and that\'s typical for Congress. In 2016, incumbents won 97% of the time. So ""calling the winner"" is not a very big achievement. Which were the ""close"" races that they got 90% correct? Just looking at 2018 Senate races I see only 5 races decided by less than 5% (three of which were called ""correctly"") and 9 races decided by less than 10% (6 of which were called ""correctly""). But even that is discounting the races said to be close that weren\'t, or that races said not to be close that were. Why isn\'t that considered a polling failure?\n\nI say that if somebody polling at 51% ends up winning with 65% that\'s a huge polling failure; I don\'t care if they got the ""correct"" winner, they were greatly outside the MoE.', 'Again, you should stop using the term margin of error when you don’t even know what it means.

You seem to think cherry picking random examples of things being outside the margin proves something. \n\nThe fact is you just have no clue what you’re talking about while I’ve been employed as a data scientist and have a masters in statistics.

You are using terms you simply do not understand.\n\nIowa May still end up outside of the margin of error, or it may be within, that’s the nature of the beast, it does not matter to the accuracy of polls overall. The fact that you’re even posing this question in this way demonstrates how little you know about statistics. \n\nMy faith in polls will have been misplaced if in the post Mortem analysis, some systemic issue in polling is discovered that hasn’t been discovered before. What happens in Iowa alone is legitimately meaningless to that determination. Even if Iowa is dead on the average, that could still be the case, likewise, if Iowa is off by 10 points that might not be the case.', '> There was a sampling problem, that’s been fixed.\n\nHow do you know it\'s been fixed? Sure, it\'s been changed. But has it been changed correctly? What elections have taken place since the pollsters changed their sample to demonstrate that they are doing it correctly now?\n\nAnd if there was a sampling problem in 2014, why wasn\'t it fixed in 2016? And why wasn\'t it fixed in 2018? Why would you trust the same people who didn\'t fix anything in the last 2 elections when they assure us that this time they actually fixed it?\n\n>My faith in polls will have been misplaced if in the post Mortem analysis, some systemic issue in polling is discovered that hasn’t been discovered before. What happens in Iowa is legitimately meaningless to that determination. Even if Iowa is dead on the average, that could still be the case, likewise, if Iowa is off by 10 points that might not be the case.\n\nIt sounds like you are more interested in the process then the results. I say if your process doesn\'t produce good results, it\'s not a trustworthy process. Reminds me of an old joke, ""But Herr Professor, the facts don\'t agree with your theory! // All the worse for the facts!""', 'Literally just told you how it was fixed. They have accurate demographics they can use to weight their samples, which they backtested. Granted, I know these words mean nothing to you as they fly right over your head so this is a waste of time.\n\nThey’ve done the mid terms since then, which despite your uninformed insistence on cherry picking random data, was one of the most accurate elections for polls of all time. The biggest issue with the midterms was actually that polls were TOO correct, which implies something might actually be off as with random errors you expect to be wrong a certain amount. You just don’t understand how to actually interpret statistics. You prefer to cherry pick data that supports the view that helps you cope with the reality of the impending election.', '>They have accurate demographics they can use to weight their samples, which they backtested.\n\nIf it\'s that simple, why did nobody do it in 2016? Only a couple of polling orgs said Trump was going to win, dozens said he was losing big in Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n> They’ve done the mid terms since then, which despite your uninformed insistence on cherry picking random data, was one of the most accurate elections for polls of all time.\n\nIf that\'s one of the most accurate of all time, it\'s a pretty low bar. Less than half of the predictions within the margin of error is considered an amazing success?\n\nMeanwhile, I checked on your claim that polls with bigger margins are expected to have bigger margins of error. Found a recent one here  https://www.news9.com/story/5f90b311788f4939f00759e5/news-9news-on-6-exclusive-poll:-inhofe-leads-broyles-by-20-points-in-us-senate-race that shows the incumbent with a huge lead, but the MoE is stated to be plus or minus 1.32%. I guess you know better than SoonerPoll.com, maybe you should write to them and explain that the MoE is actually much larger.\n\nHere\'s another one by a different pollster: https://www.realclearpolitics.com/docs/2020/Mason_Dixon_Kentucky_October_20,_2020.pdf. They say that the MoE is plus or minus 4%, even though the margin of the poll is 17%. Furthermore, they go on to say that ""according to standards customarily used by statisticians"" there is a 95% chance that the actual result is within that 4-point margin of error (actually 8 points if you include the plus and the minus).\n\nYou might say it doesn\'t matter because KY is a shoe-in for Trump anyway. But the polling org themselves note that Trump carried KY by 30 points last time. The implication is that Trump is running 13±4 points behind his result in 2016. And this is the kind of thing that 538 uses to calibrate their predictions for places demographically similar to KY.\n\nNow maybe that poll is correct. Maybe Trump is winning KY by only 9 instead of 30, and he\'s going to get walloped in the general election. But if he wins KY by more than 17, that is something that is supposed to have only a 5% chance of happening! And when he overperforms in multiple states well outside the margin of error, I can\'t believe it\'s a 5% chance for each of those to happen. If only 5% of the polls were outside the MoE, fine. That\'s what they told us to expect. But when there\'s ~50% of the polls outside the MoE, it\'s a BIG problem with the polling. I don\'t care if you call it a sample or a model, it means the polls were untrustworthy.\n\nAnd I hold them just as accountable when a Democrat overperforms their polls outside of the MoE. It should happen only 1 poll in 20, not in half or more. This is why I do not say that Trump is guaranteed to win, only that I do not trust the polls.\n\nGranted there are a couple weeks left and maybe a newer poll of KY will be released that shows a different number. We will see.', 'Again, your lack of understanding on a subject matter doesn’t somehow make you right. \n\nYou don’t know what a Margin of error is or how to interpret it or how to apply it, but you consistently talk about it as though you do.\n\nPolls called the winner in 98% of races in the midterms and 90% of close races. Yes, that is a huge success considering there were over 500 races. And if you look at the data correctly, the margin of error was 3% (not that you know what that means), and the errors were randomly distributed.\n\nThis weird phenomenon amongst conservatives where they feel uninformed layman opinions are as valuable as expert opinions speaks volumes about why the party is in shambles and none of them seem to realize it.\n\nRe margin of error, There is the historic average margin of error, which is roughly 3% for close races, and much wider, historically for not close races. These are based on predictions vs outcomes after the fact. \n\nThen there is another margin of error calculated based on sample size and polling data prior to the outcome.  This is something completely different provides a feel for data quality that will fly over a layman’s head and is part of why layman opinions aren’t worth anything. Though anyone with basic reasoning can spend 4 minutes figuring out that clearly after the fact margins aren’t the same as sample margins.\n\nIn this particular poll, they’ve conducted “the largest state wide poll of all time”, which infers high data quality, hence a low margin of error. This doesn’t change the historic margin of error nor will it change the true error calculated after the fact. \n\nThe reason margins are typically higher in not close races is quite obvious, we don’t generally poll as much because it’s a waste of resources when everyone knows who will win. Less data means bigger errors.', '> Polls called the winner in 98% of races in the midterms and 90% of close races.\n\nIncumbents won 91% of the races in 2018 and that\'s typical for Congress. In 2016, incumbents won 97% of the time. So ""calling the winner"" is not a very big achievement. Which were the ""close"" races that they got 90% correct? Just looking at 2018 Senate races I see only 5 races decided by less than 5% (three of which were called ""correctly"") and 9 races decided by less than 10% (6 of which were called ""correctly""). But even that is discounting the races said to be close that weren\'t, or that races said not to be close that were. Why isn\'t that considered a polling failure?\n\nI say that if somebody polling at 51% ends up winning with 65% that\'s a huge polling failure; I don\'t care if they got the ""correct"" winner, they were greatly outside the MoE.', 'Again, you should stop using the term margin of error when you don’t even know what it means. You’re embarrassing yourself.', ""I'm quoting the term used in the Mason-Dixon pdf. If you think they are using it wrong you'd better write and tell them how to use it properly."", 'Pulling a word off of a document doesn’t mean you understand it or are using it correctly. You do not understand a margin of error or how to interpret it or apply it one bit, and you don’t care to listen to people who do. You seem to think things should only be outside of it 5% of the time, which i think you’re tragically confusing with a p value or something. You seem to think cherry picking random examples of things being outside the margin proves something. \n\nThe fact is you just have no clue what you’re talking about while I’ve been employed as a data scientist and have a masters in statistics. Yet you’re pretty sure you know better because you read a conservative blog.']",israelnationalnews.com

No. They provide a public utility (in this case an online message board) that more than a billion people use. One person can\'t have the power to influence 1 billion people over what can and cannot be shared on said internet message board.', 'How is twitter a monopoly? How are they anti-competitive?

The answer is to turn off twitter and walk away.', 'Thats really really funny, because multiple writers at the post refused to put their name on it because of how ridiculous it is.

Should Stack Overflow lose that protection if they decide to delete user-generated content that does not belong?', 'Sure if Twitter and Facebook was like Myspace in 2004. Sharing tunes, posting your poetry, showing off that spicey selfie.\n\nNow they are are allowing or disallowing what information flows, who gets heard or not, and deciding what journalism is. They are harvesting your data, not only what you do on Twitter, but where you go, who your friends are, what you say around smart devices with a mic, what you buy, what you search online for, then use that data either to sell as a commodity or as data on how to manipulate you. What to buy, what celebrity to care about, what Marxist ideal you should support or who to vote for.', 'Seeing as they buy or copy all of their competition’s best qualities, spend billions making sure they’re the top result on all marketing, and censor content on their own platform leading to any legitimate competition I’d call it close to a monopoly. There are essentially no regulations that keep them in check. Their product dominates the sector so much that the barrier to entry prohibits anyone from competing without billions of dollars to spend', 'I know you dont want this to be true.\n\nSignature real.\n\nLaptops real. \n\nEmails real.\n\nChild porn real.\n\nCorruption real\n\nTony Bobulinski real.', 'whats true about it?  if you actually have standards for what you classify as a ""fact"", there isn\'t a single verifiable fact in it except the existence of the repair shop.', 'They should unban the post instead', 'Bad news for Democrats ""does not belong"" on Twitter? That\'s an interesting rule.\n\nDid Twitter pull the fake stories about Trump? Nope. This is a real story that is far more credible than Russian Collusion or Trump saying he hates soldiers. Yet Twitter happily let those stories get shared on their service for years.', 'What? Stack overflow is for coding and programming. Stack overflow doesn\'t have the kind of engagement reach that Twitter and Facebook have. No one uses stack overflow if they aren\'t into programming. I don\'t code, so I have no use for it. \n\nFacebook and Twitter, for example, ARE platforms that have insane levels of engagement reach. 1,000,000,000+ people. But frankly section 230 needs to be overturned. \n\n47 USC § 230, Section C-2\n>No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of 1) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected; or 2) any action taken to enable or make available to information content providers or others the technical means to restrict access to material described in paragraph.\n\nMy interpretation of this section is that these services cannot be held liable if they restrict content on their computer service. In the phrase ""otherwise objectionable"" can mean anything that Twitter or Facebook doesn\'t like. hence why Jack Dorsey was able to restrict the New York post\'s article without any punishment. And for a platform that has over a billion users, It seems to me that\'s a violation of free speech regardless of what section 230 says.', ""\n>Now they are are allowing or disallowing what information flows, who gets heard or not, and deciding what journalism is. \n\nWhat I don't understand is how what Twitter is doing isn't protected by the first amendment."", ""They aren't because I use neither platform.

It also strains belief Hunter would fly from CA to Delaware to visit a tiny super pro Trump laptop repair store, rather than an apple store, or send an assassistant. Do you think Erid Trump himself would go drop off personal laptops for repair?\n\n2. Yes laptops are real, thinking they\'re Hunters because a blind laptop repair man who: doesn\'t have video evidence of Hunter entering the building, and admitted he couldn\'t recognize him at the time is ridiculous.\n\n3. Some of them are, thats how a disinformation campaign like this works. Release the meta data to prove it. Its that easy. But hiding behind ""Well this email can be verified without it so the others are also real!"" Is false logic. Each email has a truth and false value. Confirming one has no effect on any other.\n\n4.If the child porn was real, you realize Giuliani and the shop owner committed multiple felonies by copying and continuing to possess it right?

And again, nothing has proven its hunters laptops.\n\n5.Yes just look at the current administration, incredibly corrupt.\n\n6.Yes he is.

He could also be doing this thing called lying, thats why actually verifying documents is important.', ""If it was false you'd think the people being accused would come out with a statement to refute it, but yet crickets from the Bidens."", ""What's great about setting an impossible standard for evidence is you can dismiss anything you don't like, even if it's clearly legitimate. Not even the Bidens are decrying this as fake as much as you are, they only deflect to Trump. Do you really have a hard time believing a guy who once left his ID and a crack-pipe in a returned rental car forgot to delete stuff from a laptop?"", 'Well duh', '>Bad news for Democrats ""does not belong"" on Twitter?

In the phrase ""otherwise objectionable"" can mean anything that Twitter or Facebook doesn\'t like.\n\nI agree that is what it means. The overall goal of Section 230 to promote free and open speech via online platforms. It does so by explicitly defining service providers as something other than a publisher, limiting their liability for hosting user generated content.\n\nThis portion ensures that the service providers\' freedom of speech is preserved. It does this by explicitly stating that they can remove content they find objectionable even if that content is legal, constitutionally-protected speech of a user. Service providers are not forced to host content they do not feel is appropriate for their platform.\n\n>And for a platform that has over a billion users, It seems to me that\'s a violation of free speech regardless of what section 230 says.\n\nForcing a platform, regardless of the number of users, to host content they do not find appropriate would infringe on their free speech.', 'It\'s against the spirit of the first amendment but not a violation of the law since Twitter is not the  government.\n\n""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech...""', '[removed]', 'Their FCC protections dictate they are a platform not a publisher. While they have a theme of content, they do not get to curate their content.', ""So what's more important? The free speech of the service provider?  Or the free speech of the users? When the servicer itself knowingly blocks information because they think it's controversial that's questionable to me. In such an environment where the platform engages billions of people, knowingly removing content that a single person thinks is questionable without having input from its users is a violation of free speech. \n\nSomebody can't build a wooden message board, stick it in the middle of town, say that this message board is free to use, But then watch it like a hawk and tear down messages people put up just because those messages might be controversial. If you want to build a message board for people to share information but at the same time want to police the information on the board, Don't make it a free public service. Don't build a business model that is fundamentally designed to have a large outreach but then at the same time control the narrative ."", ""Riiight...

GM reversed their plans in shutting down a Detroit factory and they’re investing billions in plant and want to have battery plant as well for their electric vehicles there. Fiat Chrysler said they were going to spend billions on new production in Michigan including a Jeep factory in Detroit creating jobs. In 2016 Trump was very vocal in criticizing automakers leaving and shipping jobs out. He was adamant on getting them to invest in plants in Midwest and create those jobs. Not sure if you’re in Michigan and know more, but I haven’t seen any of these plans I listed as changing. Because of this I don’t see how Trump now loses Michigan, I’d imagine he’d win by larger margin!\n\nI also agree in Wisconsin along with Ohio and Pennsylvania; I think he actually flips Minnesota finally too.

They weren\'t trying, the hackers knew how to make the hack look Russian, perhaps a little too obviously.  \n\nFurther, all the FBI had was analysis on hacking into a congressional staffers personal computer.  Which they say they cross referenced with screen caps from crowdstrike.  Screen caps containing ""fingerprints"" any serious hacker could fraudulently leave behind.  The FBI didn\'t get to conduct their own analysis because they were not allowed to by the DNC.\n\n[https://www.zerohedge.com/political/no-proof-russia-hacked-dnc-democrats-hid-sworn-crowdstrike-testimony-over-2-years](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/no-proof-russia-hacked-dnc-democrats-hid-sworn-crowdstrike-testimony-over-2-years)\n\nMoral of the story, if you\'re a political organization in the middle of an election and you think your being hacked, tell the FBI. But the DNC didn\'t just not ask the FBI to look at it, they refused to let the FBI look at it.  \n\n""Here, take our firms word for it"". Sorry, you don\'t get to undermine our election based on info paid for by the DNC.', 'Lol that’s why I clarified that that was your position. It’s ridiculously untenable. \n\nYes your article says they relied on it, not that they relied upon it and it alone, with no other intel to corroborate it. \n\nLook, if you’re convinced the entire government intel apparatus (while headed by a Republican administration) is lying to you, obviously someone on the internet isn’t going to change your mind. \n\nBut every intel agency, the house committee on intel, and the senate committee on intel all agree: Russians hacked the DNC. And you have no way of knowing what intel they relied on or what other sources they have or that the intel was wrong. So keep on keepin on I guess.', 'It is widely agreed upon that Podesta fell for a phishing attempt from the Russians through his Gmail. As far as the DNC server, no one ever proved it was even “hacked” since CrowdStrike only handed over select portions they copied themselves. \n\nI’ve seen some people claim the file transfers that CrowdStrike did provide from the “hacking” were actually conducted at rates on par with an external hard drive, rather than the transfer rates that would come from the information being uploaded via the internet. \n\nThe whole Romanian -> Ukrainian -> Russian -> WikiLeaks trail seems like a pretty sketchy story and chain to go through just to release a few emails that made Bernie supporters mad and led to the Pizzagate dude almost going postal.\n\nWhat’s not as hard to believe to me is that we (The US) were hacking Iran and North Korea’s nuclear/missile programs to make them fail, so in return the intelligence community had to claim they’re now hacking us to further escalate these cyber-wars. \n\nI know, conspiracy level stuff.. but I wouldn’t put it past our government to do something like that.']",wsj.com

There isn’t a case or real life situation I can imagine where a judge would say “ok let’s go through all the rights in the Bill of Rights; attorneys no peeking!”  Of course that’s sarcasm, but it highlights how stupid the question is.\n\nA more appropriate question would be, “What Const. issues might a petitioner raise in a civil proceeding following a federal agents’ arrest of a journalist, who was praying in a public park?”\n\nAnother easy question would be, “Generally speaking, what is the right to free speech?”  Or “Generally speaking, may a state actor restrict a woman’s right to abort a fetus.”  These questions account for nuance and complexity.\n\nThis candidate, as deplorable as she is, is a highly qualified jurist, very intelligent, and has much experience.  Her high level of competence is a singular threat to the US, our freedom from religion, and democracy.  Imagine if Trump had an IQ above 70 how dangerous he would be.\n\nI have no idea what you mean about no rule that dogs can’t play basketball.']",marijuanamoment.net

"Eugenics is making a comeback. Resist, before history repeats itself",85,jbvses,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-10-14/trump-eugenics-politics-history,1,1602823065.0,,Progressive,"['If you have problems with the paywall, here is the text of the op-ed:\n\n---\n\nPoliticians often flatter their audiences, but at a rally in Bemidji, Minn., last month, President Trump found an unusual thing to praise about the nearly all-white crowd: its genetics. “You have good genes,” he insisted. “A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? The racehorse theory. … You have good genes in Minnesota.”\n\nIn case it was not clear from the sea of white faces that he was making a point about race, Trump later said the quiet part out loud. “Every family in Minnesota needs to know about Sleepy Joe Biden’s extreme plan to flood your state with an influx of refugees from Somalia, from other places all over the planet,” he declared.\n\nTrump’s ugly endorsement of race-based eugenics got national attention, but in a presidency filled with outrages, our focus quickly moved to the next. Besides, this wasn’t the first time we’d heard about these views. A “Frontline”documentary reported in 2016 that Trump believed the “racehorse theory” of human development that he referred to in Minnesota — that superior men and women will have superior children. That same year, the Huffington Post released a video collecting Trump’s statements on human genetics, including his declarations that “I’m a gene believer” and “I’m proud to have that German blood.”\n\nOn eugenics, as in so many areas, the scariest thing about Trump’s views is not the fact that he holds them, but that there is no shortage of Americans who share them. The United States has a long, dark history with eugenics. Starting in 1907, a majority of states passed laws authorizing the sterilization of people deemed to have undesirable genes, for reasons as varied as “feeblemindedness” and alcoholism. The Supreme Court upheld these laws by an 8-1 vote, in the infamous 1927 case Buck vs. Bell, and as many as 70,000 Americans were sterilized for eugenic reasons in the 20th century.\n\nAmerica’s passion for eugenics waned after World War II, when Nazism discredited the idea of dividing people based on the quality of their genes. But in recent years, public support for eugenics has made a comeback. Steve King, a Republican congressman from Iowa, tweeted in 2017, “We can’t restore our civilization with somebody else’s babies.” The comment struck many as a claim that American children were genetically superior, though King later insisted he was concerned with “the culture, not the blood” of foreign babies.\n\nEugenics has also had a resurgence in England, where the movement was first launched in the 1880s by Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin. In February, Andrew Sabisky, an advisor to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, resigned after it was revealed that he had reportedly written blog posts suggesting that there are genetic differences in intelligence among races, and that compulsory contraception could be used to prevent the rise of a “permanent underclass.” Richard Dawkins, one of Britain’s most prominent scientists, added fuel to the fire by tweeting that although eugenics could be criticized on moral or ideological grounds, “of course” it would “work in practice.” Eugenics “works for cows, horses, pigs, dogs & roses,” he said. “Why on earth wouldn’t it work for humans?”\n\nThere is reason to believe the eugenics movement will continue to grow. America’s first embrace of it came at a time when immigration levels were high, and it was closely tied to fears that genetically “inferior” foreigners were hurting the nation’s gene pool. Eugenicists persuaded Congress to pass the Immigration Act of 1924, which sharply reduced the number of Italian, Jewish and Asian people allowed in.\n\nToday, the percentage of Americans who were born outside the United States is the highest it has been since 1910, and fear of immigrants is again an animating force in politics. As our nation continues to become more diverse, the sort of xenophobia that fueled Trump‘s and King’s comments is likely to produce more talk of “better” genes and babies.\n\nIt is critically important to push back against these toxic ideas. One way to do this is by ensuring that people who promote eugenics are denounced and kept out of positions of power. It is encouraging that Sabisky was forced out and that King was defeated for reelection in his Republican primary in June. Hopefully, Trump will be the next to go.\n\nEducation, including an honest reckoning with our own tragic eugenics history, is another form of resistance. It is starting to happen: Stanford University just announced that it is removing the name of its first president, David Starr Jordan, a leading eugenicist, from campus buildings, and that it will actively work to better explain his legacy. We need more of this kind of self-scrutiny from universities like Harvard, Yale and many others that promoted eugenics and pseudo race science, as well as institutions like the American Museum of Natural History, which in 1921 hosted the Second International Eugenics Congress, at which eugenicists advocated for eliminating the “unfit.”\n\nTrump’s appalling remarks in Minnesota show how serious the situation is now. Seventy-five years after the liberation of the Nazi concentration camps, a United States president not only spoke about “good genes” in racialized terms — he believed that his observations would help him to win in the relatively liberal state of Minnesota. It is crucial that everyone who understands the horrors of eugenics works to defeat these views — before they become any more popular.']","Eugenics is making a comeback.

She contracted COVID in July and is still not recovered.  She has a cardiologist appointment today to try to address her persistent shortness of breath and frequent chest pain.  Herd Immunity is asinine.  Trump’s only plan is to address this crisis in negligent homicide.  VOTE!', ""Oh yeah herd immunity let the weak die. We'll be at 8 million by Friday. We're gaining a million about every 25 days. 2.4% of the US population have it. For every case 2.75% die. We're at 215k dead we'll be at 270k dead by the end of the year. 3rd leading cause of death in the US. \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1crj8B67FODebXmqi-gU41eSMn3xD4c1xJSWi_bjYVho/edit?usp=sharing"", 'Herd immunity means that some of us are expendable to the GOP.

First, it was determined early on that herd immunity was not possible, mostly because the antibodies you receive from being exposed to COVID only last a maximum of 3 months - that’s tops!  Second, we are still learning about this virus and are unsure why it causes such debilitating illness and possibly death in some otherwise healthy individuals.  That is a chance that I’m not willing to take (besides the fact that I am neither young nor otherwise healthy, but I digress).  I 100% agree with this statement:\n \n“I’m extremely concerned that the president is being advised by people who speak of herd immunity,” Haseltine said, adding: “herd immunity is another word for mass murder.”\n\nIf that were really a solution or an option - why are we the only idiotic country proposing that bull shit?  (Now, I mean). I blame it on the defunding of education and this anti intellectualism sentiment being touted by -you guessed it - Republicans!  It’s just sad that >50% of American adults are unable to read at a 5th grade level and about 1 in 7 American adults are functionally illiterate.  Considering those facts it is easy to see why half the country is against wearing masks - THEY DON’T HAVE THE MENTAL CAPACITY OR THE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS TO EVEN UNDERSTAND the available literature on COVID - that’s why they believe the propaganda put out by this administration like mass murder, I mean herd immunity. I just want to scream!  The dumbing down of America is complete and we are falling quickly!  Wake up!', 'The virus also embraces herd immunity as its best chance to flourish and to mutate into the most effective pathogen that it can be.', ""It's so they can kill off everyone with preexisting conditions and claim they are going to protect them in the next invisible health care bill\n\nAlso, how's herd immunity without a vaccine gonna work? This is just more gopspeak"", ""First it would go away. Then we were in a war against covid. Now it's just *surrender* to the pestilence, and take the deaths and long term heart damage. Meanwhile the Democrats don't want to approve a bill allegedly to fight covid because it includes yet more huge tax breaks for millionaires instead of helping states and cities fight the pandemic."", ""These morons think we're close to herd immunity because the rest of us are being responsible."", ""Herd immunity is what's left after most of the herd dies."", ""So what exactly is the threshold mortality rate for the GOP to decide that it's worth it to shut down to save lives?  We've established that 1% is nowhere near high enough.  I'm guessing that they might *consider* it if fucking rabies (99.99999%) became airborne."", 'That’s a heck of a “punchline”', 'I\'m not sure but I could imagine that those of this mind-set would be agreeable to enacting a policy of [""Lebensunwertes Leben""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_unworthy_of_life).', ""Yup. And you know what this person would do if the White House actually enacted such a policy? He'd write a *strongly worded letter*, perhaps publish an oped in nothing less than the Washington Post or even the New York Times. And not only him! A LOT of other people, maybe even Dr. Fauci and people who actually work for the government, would make *strong statements* that could be interpreted as being *not fully in line with the Trump administration!* Even congresspeople would deliver strong statements. There would be so many strong statements that it would be mind-boggling. And if millions really did die? There would be even *more* strong statements. Can you even imagine how many strong statements there would be?"", '>Herd immunity means that some of us are expendable to the GOP.\n\nIt has always been the case. People die because they can\'t afford health care. People die because of air and water pollution, wildfires and hurricanes. People die at work because of the lack of regulations. People die in custody because prisons need to remain full with slaves. Kids die in school shootings because ""\'muh guns"".

It's doesn't really mean much if your immune system is destroyed. I don't know about the other case, but I suspect it might be something similar. \n\nIt makes for good clickbait, but it's not necessarily that relevant.

Each of the two parties had a unified strategy, which they carried out with discipline. And those strategies were extremely revealing of this political moment and the future of the Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats decided that their focus would be the potential real-world effects of Barrett ascending to the court and creating a bulletproof 6-3 conservative majority. While there are many issues they could have discussed — Roe v. Wade, the Voting Rights Act, workers’ rights — they chose to stick with the Affordable Care Act, which the court could strike down in a case it will hear right after the election.\n\nUnlike Republicans, Democrats had no need to conceal their policy intentions or their hopes and fears about the court. The ACA has never been more popular, and if the GOP lawsuit — supported by nearly every Republican-run state government and the Trump administration — succeeds, the result will be nothing short of a health-care cataclysm, with an estimated 23 million Americans losing health coverage and all of us losing protections for preexisting conditions.\n\nSo Democrats adorned the hearing room with posters of individual Americans who could lose their coverage if Barrett does what Republicans ask of her and votes to strike down the ACA. One after another told the heartbreaking stories of their constituents whose futures are at stake.\n\nRepublicans knew this was coming, and their strategy is familiar to anyone who watched the confirmation hearing for any Republican nominee in the past few decades. It’s pretty much the only response available to a party that 1) is eager to install judicial activists on the bench who will advance its policy agenda, but 2) knows that agenda is extraordinarily unpopular.\n\nWhat it requires is a series of lies: lies about how the judiciary works, about what Republicans know and believe, and what they fervently hope that Barrett and all Republican-appointed judges will do once they’re on the bench.\n\nThe most overarching lie Republicans told is that they want judges who understand that politics have no role in judging. They lamented the fact that we no longer simply accept that if a judge is qualified, no matter their political beliefs, they should be confirmed (Merrick Garland can testify to how sincere Republicans are about that).\n\n“You and I both know that judges should not be policymakers,” said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.). “Judges should not be unelected super-legislators, giving their political allies wins they could not secure through the rough-and-tumble of the political process.”\n\nWhy, Republicans would be heart-stricken if a court ever gave them a win they could not obtain through the political process!\n\n“Democrats view the court as a super-legislature,” agreed Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.). “Who in their right mind would want the United States of America ruled by five unelected lawyers in black robes?”\n\nIf you don’t recall Cruz raising this objection when the court’s conservative majority eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, for instance, that’s because he didn’t.\n\nSome went even deeper, their voices dripping with fake sincerity. “Politicizing the courts,” said Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), “is a violation of our oath to the Constitution.”\n\nBarrett knows exactly the part she is to play in this ridiculous farce. In her opening statement — with text no doubt approved by the White House — Barrett insisted that there is no policy preference that might infect her unsullied thinking on every constitutional question.\n\n“The policy decisions and value judgments of government must be made by the political branches elected by and accountable to the People,” it reads. “The public should not expect courts to do so, and courts should not try.”\n\nTo make it clear, the case all the Democrats were talking about is one in which Republicans are demanding that the court overrule Congress to give Republicans a win they could not obtain via ordinary politics. And when in previous cases the Supreme Court declined to strike down the ACA, Republicans didn’t breathe a sigh of relief that the court stayed out of such a political question. They filed more lawsuits.\n\nBut now they claim that they neither know nor care how Barrett might rule on the ACA, Roe v. Wade or any other case. “I will object anytime anyone tries to attribute to you a policy position,” said Sen. Mike Lee (Utah).\n\nAnd Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) said of the assertion that Barrett would strike down the ACA, “That’s outrageous. As a mother of seven, Judge Barrett clearly understands the importance of health care.”\n\nIn other words, no one who has family members she loves could possibly be so callous, so villainous, so monstrous as to agree with the position of the entire Republican Party and rule the way Republican states and a Republican administration demands. How could you even suggest such a thing?\n\nEvery Republican in that room shares a determination to pack the courts with as many far-right judges as possible, to move American law in a radically more conservative direction.

Incredibly, there are another thirty-one staffers in her office with total comp exceeding $200,000 annually.

>Police and Sheriff departments– The combined 4,418 employees of the city’s law enforcement agencies cost taxpayers $831 million in compensation last year for an average cost of over $188,000 per person. The police are called “peace officers.”

>Because San Francisco is both a city and a county, it has both a sheriff and police department. Sheriff deputies run the jails, enforce civil judgements, and provide security for court cases, while the police patrol the city.

>Police Chief William Scott earned $434,613 ($338,482 salary and $96,131 benefits). Four assistant chiefs (police and management) received between $346,528 and $445,539. Then, there were 195 employees with pay and perks exceeding $300,000 each.

Maybe should post somewhere else, but don't know where. Thought this came out to be an interesting way to present talking/discussion points. 

This comment was in response to someone asking how important letters of recommendation are, and how a even critical letter might be 'ok' or even in some cases good for the applicant...

&nbsp;


""Sometimes a critical letter might be a an issue/factor that isn't important to me. Also, not all professors (or bosses) are 'good', or a good match for the student/applicant, so you have to be quite careful what you read, and who is the letter-writer.

If there are some critical things, but they are thoughtful comments and look manageable, then I think it's good because that means the letter-writer is engaged with the student/applicant, which is positive overall. I look at student/applicant performance then to see if the criticism and performance 'match', e.g. written work/pubs, grades, etc., and likely I'd bring it up in the interview and see what she/he has to say.

I'd very rarely write someone off though for a critical letter.

&nbsp;


Having said that, however, I have had some really critical letters, like:

&nbsp;


""The applicant appears to have no background, his/her credentials are suspect or completely made up, and lies about everything. The applicant falsifies their work and blames other people when they are discovered and for every ensuing problem (especially problems they made themselves) and actively tries to destroy clearly honorable people if they argue or try and defend themselves.

The applicant shows no empathy or consideration for others at all, even to the point of mocking and mimicking their physical disabilities and appearances in both public and private meetings. The person calls people childish and sometimes obscene names in public, and uses extremely vulgar language in meetings and interviews.

The person is clearly racist, and encourages other racists in public and private including 'white-power' groups to commit violence against other students. The applicant stated in public and on record that 'I could shoot somebody...in the street, kill them, and nobody would care...because it's me.'

Finally, the applicant actively denies critical scientific findings and truth, even faced with undeniable proof, endangering everyone near to him/her. Because of that many of his/her associates and my other students and colleagues have fallen severely ill or died.""

But he said we must be “cautious about drawing any conclusions until there’s been a proper investigation.”\n\nKonyndyk noted that the event was outdoors, which “would have mitigated the risk somewhat.” At the same time, he said, “people were chatting in close proximity for quite a long time,” and this was a “mass gathering event where you know people were not following some of the basic prevention protocols.”\n\nThis “mass gathering event,” however, involved the president of the United States and a handful of top advisers, a would-be Supreme Court justice and numerous members of the party that controls the U.S. Senate.\n\nWhich raises serious implications for how GOP senators should now proceed.

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said on MSNBC on Friday.\n\n“We can’t move forward on Amy Coney Barrett or anything else,” Murphy continued, “until we know whether there was some superspreader event at the White House, or at that debate, which has resulted in perhaps more Senate staff than Mike Lee contracting this disease.”\n\nIndeed, as Jennifer Rubin points out, moving forward on Barrett at this point might violate guidelines from Trump’s own Centers for Disease Control.\n\nReally, this is utter madness.

Those groups -if they are responsible for terrorism, rioting, or looting- should be labeled as such. It's interesting that you mention these groups are anarchists under the umbrella of antifa, but you don't jump to classify anarchism as terrorism...\n\nYou seem to have misunderstood (or not read) the article. Environmentalism is an ideology. There are good and bad environmental groups, some have even been responsible terrorist attacks. To label all environmentalism as a terrorist organization is obviously nonsensical. To label the entire ideology of antifascism as a terrorist organization is just as ridiculous. If there was an organized group of antifascists that were responsible for or calling for terrorism, that group should be labelled as a terrorist organization. That's not what Trump is arguing though.""]",apnews.com

She will almost certainly be approved by senators representing less than 45 percent of the American population.  \n>  \n>Our nation is moving even deeper into minority rule: The House aside, the U.S. government is controlled by the less popular party in a polarized two-party system. We may call this unfair, but that would trivialize the problem. It is entirely permissible under the Constitution, and it is dangerous. When the majority of a nation’s citizens can’t get its candidates elected or its preferred policies passed, the government’s legitimacy is compromised and destabilizing pressure begins to build.  \n>  \n>The tendency toward minority rule in the United States, present since the founding, has become more acute. That’s certainly true in the Senate: California has 68 times as many residents that Wyoming has, but the same number of senators. The disparity in population size between the biggest and smallest states is far greater than anything the founders knew.  \n>  \n>Residents of rural, sparsely populated states are vastly overrepresented in the Senate. And because the electoral college is based on the number of federal representatives, this rural-state overrepresentation plays out in the selection of presidents, as well. Former vice president Joe Biden could well win the popular vote by three or four percentage points, or even more, this fall and still not be elected.  \n>  \n>The House, the most democratic institution in the three branches of government, has no role in selecting Supreme Court justices. That’s the purview of the president and the Senate, which means that the composition of the high court has a minoritarian, rural-state bias built into it as well. (According to a Washington Post-ABC News Poll, only 38 percent of Americans say the replacement for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the current Senate; 57 percent say the nomination should be left to the winner of the presidential election, and put to a Senate vote next year.) Should a Trump nominee be confirmed, the Supreme Court will consist of six justices appointed by Republicans, even though the party has won the popular presidential vote only once in the past seven elections (George W. Bush, in 2004).  \n>  \n>On its own, a rural state bias in representation is potentially problematic but not invidious. Plenty of issues in rural states should receive national attention, of course. But the problems mount when one party dominates the rural areas and the other dominates the urban ones, which is where we stand today. Republicans essentially get bonus points: They can be the less popular party and still get to govern.  \n>  \n>Political science research reveals that ideologically extreme parties tend to do worse in elections than more moderate parties, and that parties that find themselves in the minority — and out of power — recognize the problem and recalibrate toward the center. But because of their built-in systemic advantage, Republicans face no such check. They have come to prefer winning narrowly with committed partisans than winning broadly with unreliable moderates. Such a strategy helped bring the nation President Trump.  \n>  \n>This presents a further problem: How are Democrats to respond to an increasingly extreme, Trumpist Republican Party? Democratic leaders, when pressed with examples of Trump’s latest malfeasance, typically respond with, in effect, a one-word answer: “Vote.” It’s good advice, of course. But what if it’s not enough?

But how many such defeats will they take in stride? There may be a tipping point at which the situation becomes intolerable.  \n>  \n>Since George Floyd’s death, in police custody, at the end of May, enormous numbers of protesters (many, although hardly all, Black) have taken to the streets to demand change. They have done so in large part because, with considerable justification, they don’t think that working within the system — voting regularly, calling their elected officials, showing up at city council meetings, etc. — is producing the change they need. Black people are still being killed by police officers who face few or no consequences. Protest and unrest are a predictable outcome when a population thinks the political system is completely unresponsive to its needs.  \n>  \n>Imagine that dynamic multiplied many times over. When well more than half the country votes for one result — over and over — and continues to get another, the situation is unsustainable. This is how a government loses its legitimacy. Governments worldwide facing legitimacy crises have been faced with struggling to govern, as we saw in the Philippines under Ferdinand Marcos, or brutally cracking down on protests, as we saw in Egypt under Hosni Mubarak and continue to see under Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. It’s an ugly situation, and the United States is not immune.  \n>  \n>Reform is possible — in theory. The Constitution can be amended to substantially change the electoral college procedure, as happened in 1804 when the 12th Amendment was ratified, allowing separate votes for president and vice president. But as long as one party considers the current system advantageous, it’s hard to imagine such an amendment attracting the supermajority support needed to pass. Other reforms — such as an interstate compact that would make presidential elections subject to the popular vote — are possible without an amendment.  \n>  \n>And that reform, too, faces the brutal logic of minority rule: The party in power will fight desperately to keep its entrenched advantage (and deepen it, if possible).

Trump tries one more pre-election scam,2,izq2wz,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/09/25/trump-tries-one-more-pre-election-scam/,1,1601090636.0,,Progressive,"['The full text of the op-ed follows:\n\n---\n\n“Scam” would be a better word than “plan” to describe what President Trump is trying to do with just over a month until the election. Time is short, but a president who built an entire career on cons and grifts is hoping he can manage one more swindle to alleviate one of his greatest electoral vulnerabilities.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump gave a speech touting an executive order that is supposed to deliver us all to health care nirvana. Apparently unable to ignore the elephant in the room, he mentioned the lawsuit filed by Republican states — supported by his administration — that seeks to nullify the entire Affordable Care Act:\n\n> I’m in court to terminate this really, really terrible situation. If we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions. If we lose, what we have now is better than the original — the original version of Obamacare, by far. Much better. Much better. Again, we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions.\n\nThis lawsuit will stand a much better chance of succeeding once he fills the Supreme Court seat opened up by the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If it does succeed, the lawsuit will kick 20 million people off coverage, take away subsidies that make coverage affordable for millions more, reinstate the Medicare prescription drug “doughnut hole,” disallow young people from staying on their parents’ insurance and remove the protections for people with preexisting conditions that the ACA created for the first time in U.S. history.\n\nBut Trump has a “better” plan. Just like the better future you’ll have once you give your life savings to Trump University to learn his real estate secrets.\n\nIn the software industry they call this “vaporware” — a product announced with great fanfare that never actually exists.\n\nI would point out that the ACA is over 900 pages long, as befits a law that sought to re-engineer an impossibly complex system. As Trump himself marveled when he first tried to repeal it, “Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.” Everybody knew that, except for him.\n\nTrump’s executive order, on the other hand, is not complicated at all, nor is it a “plan.” After a few pages extolling the fantastic work his administration has done on health care, it says it will do things like lower costs and expand access. How? Don’t ask.\n\nIt’s as though I said “I have a plan to become a billionaire”; you said, “Interesting — how will you do it?”; and I replied, “Step one: Become a billionaire.”\n\nI want to focus in particular on this part:\n\n> Sec. 2. Policy. It has been and will continue to be the policy of the United States to give Americans seeking healthcare more choice, lower costs, and better care and to ensure that Americans with pre-existing conditions can obtain the insurance of their choice at affordable rates.\n\nIt is already the law that people with preexisting conditions are protected, the very law Trump is trying to overturn. It’s as though Trump walked into a liquor store, pointed a gun at the cashier, and said, “It has been and will continue to be my policy that armed robbery is wrong. Now give me all the money in the register.”\n\nBut there’s one more piece of this “plan.” Trump said in his speech that in the next few weeks the government will be sending $200 prescription drug discount cards to 33 million Medicare beneficiaries. “Nobody has seen this before,” he said. “These cards are incredible.”\n\nGiven that doing so would cost $6.6 billion and the president can’t simply do that without an act of Congress, if it actually happened it would almost certainly be illegal (the White House claims they can do it through a program they’ve proposed but that does not yet exist, I kid you not). Furthermore, a one-time $200 payment does nothing to solve the enormous problem of high drug costs.\n\nAnd there’s a back story here, which is that the administration attempted to negotiate a deal with drug companies to lower costs, but the deal fell apart. Why? As the New York Times reported:\n\n> Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, insisted the drugmakers pay for $100 cash cards that would be mailed to seniors before November — “Trump Cards,” some in the industry called them.\n\n> Some of the drugmakers bridled at being party to what they feared would be seen as an 11th-hour political boost for Mr. Trump, the people familiar with the matter said.\n\nSo the administration wants to do it anyway — which, to repeat, they can’t legally do.\n\nI’m reasonably sure that the entire reason this happened at all is because of how Trump was humiliated in an ABC News town hall earlier this month. When he claimed that he would soon release a fantastic health care plan, host George Stephanopoulos pointed out that for years he has said his health care plan is about to be delivered, usually “two weeks” hence from whenever he’s speaking, yet it never comes.\n\nTrump replied weakly that “I have it all ready, and it’s a much better plan for you.” Somehow the audience refrained from bursting out in a gale of derisive laughter.\n\nFollowing that debacle, Trump probably ordered his aides to come up with something he could call a “plan,” and this is what they delivered.\n\nIn its way, it’s an appropriate coda to Trump’s efforts on health care, a combination of lies and cruelty, stopping short of outright cataclysm only because he and Republicans are too incompetent to follow through on the promise they’ve made for so long to drop a nuclear bomb on the system.\n\nBut as always, Trump has faith that there are enough simple-minded marks out there to allow him to pull another con. That faith has gotten him pretty far in life, but his luck won’t last forever.']","Trump tries one more pre-election scam['The full text of the op-ed follows:\n\n---\n\n“Scam” would be a better word than “plan” to describe what President Trump is trying to do with just over a month until the election.

Because the reality and the science of COVID-19 conflicted with his personal views, President Trump knowingly downplayed the pandemic.\n\nThis is not about the economy, taxes, health care or any other normal ballot considerations. This is about American lives unnecessarily lost. This is about businesses unnecessarily closed. This is about being guided by service to all Americans. This is about centering decisions on a higher morality. President Trump’s actions — and inaction — demonstrates that he is not concerned about any of this.\n\nAnd as damaging as his faulty leadership has been, four more years would be devastating.\n\nWe must elect a thoughtful, moral, responsible, respectful leader on Nov. 3. Our current president is not that leader.', ""He's a straight-up Russian agent.""]",denverpost.com

Lysenko was a Soviet agronomist who decided that modern genetics was all wrong, indeed contrary to Marxist-Leninist principles. He even denied that genes existed, while insisting that long-discredited views about evolution were actually right. Real scientists marveled at his ignorance.\n\nBut Joseph Stalin liked him, so Lysenko’s views became official doctrine, and scientists who refused to endorse them were sent to labor camps or executed. Lysenkoism became the basis for much of the Soviet Union’s agricultural policy, eventually contributing to the disastrous famines of the 1930s.\n\nDoes all of this sound a bit familiar given recent events in America?\n\nThose worried about a crisis of democracy in the United States — which means everyone paying attention — usually compare Donald Trump to strongmen like Hungary’s Viktor Orban and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, not Stalin. Indeed, if the G.O.P. has become an extremist, anti-democratic party — and it has — it’s an extremism of the right.\n\nBut while nobody would accuse Trump of being a leftist, his political style always reminds me of Stalinism. Like Stalin, he sees vast, implausible conspiracies everywhere — anarchists somehow in control of major cities, radical leftists somehow controlling Joe Biden, secret anti-Trump cabals throughout the federal government. It’s also notable that those who work for Trump, like Stalinist officials, consistently end up being cast out and vilified — although not sent to gulags, at least not yet.\n\nAnd Trumpism, like Stalinism, seems to inspire special disdain for expertise and a fondness for quacks.\n\nOn Wednesday Trump said two things that both, if you ask me, deserved banner headlines. Most alarmingly, he refused to commit to a peaceful transition of power if he loses the election.\n\nBut he also indicated that he might reject new guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration for approving a coronavirus vaccine, saying that the announcement of these guidelines “sounds like a political move.” What?\n\nOK, we all understand what’s going on here. Many observers worry that the Trump team, in an effort to influence the election, will announce that we have a safe, effective vaccine against the coronavirus ready to go, even if we don’t (and we almost certainly won’t have one that soon). So the Food and Drug Administration was trying to reassure the public about the integrity of its approval process.\n\nAnd we really need that reassurance, because the Trump administration has given us every reason to distrust statements coming from public health agencies.\n\nLast month the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance to the effect that people exposed to the coronavirus but not having Covid-19 symptoms didn’t need to get tested — contrary to the recommendations of just about every independent epidemiologist. Subsequent reporting revealed that the new guidance was prepared by political appointees and skipped the scientific review process.\n\nMore recently, the C.D.C. warned about airborne transmission of the coronavirus — this time matching what experts are saying — only to suddenly pull the guidance from its website a few days later. We don’t know exactly what happened, but it’s hard not to notice that the retracted guidance would have made it clear that recent Trump rallies, which involve large indoor crowds with few people wearing masks, create major public health risks.\n\nSo the F.D.A. was trying to assure us that it won’t be corrupted by politics the way the C.D.C. apparently has been. And Trump basically cut the agency off at the knees; his assertion that the new guidelines sound political actually meant that they weren’t political enough, that he wants to keep open the possibility of announcing a vaccine as a way to help retain power.\n\nBut if political hacks are calling the shots at the C.D.C., and the F.D.A. is being told to shut up and follow the party line, who’s advising Trump on pandemic policy? Send in the quacks.\n\nTrump’s disastrous push, back in April, for early reopening was reportedly influenced by the writings of Richard Epstein, a law professor who somehow decided that he was an expert in epidemiology and that Covid-19 would kill no more than 500 people, a number he eventually increased to 5,000 — roughly the death toll we’re currently experiencing every week.\n\nBut the quack of the moment is Dr. Scott Atlas, a radiologist with no expertise in infectious diseases who nonetheless impressed Trump with his appearances on Fox News. Atlas’s opposition to mask requirements and advocacy of just letting the coronavirus spread until we’ve reached “herd immunity” are very much at odds with what actual epidemiologists are saying, but they’re what Trump wants to hear, and Atlas has apparently become a key adviser on pandemic policy.\n\nThat’s what had me thinking about Trofim Lysenko.

Opinion: The GOP should seat a SCOTUS nominee before November. It will kick start a much needed reform to how we choose judges.,6,iwgb9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iwgb9n/opinion_the_gop_should_seat_a_scotus_nominee/,14,1600645952.0,"Like most of you, I hate the position the Dems are in and the GOP screwed their way into. But we're here because of the politicized nature of the SCOTUS. The highest court in the land should not be used as a political tool. But that is exactly what it has become. I'm beginning to think that the only way to fix it is by burning down the house. Let the GOP ram through a nominee. If Trump wins in November, oh well, he would be seating the nominee anyways. If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts. The next trump could come in and pack the court even more, and so on, causing a runaway effect. Or, Congress on both sides decides the extreme bipartisanship is getting out of control and actually pass a reform that everyone agrees to.",Progressive,"[""I haven't seen much over the last decade to think that the Democrats and specifically Biden would be willing to adopt those kind of aggressive tactics. They still seem to operate with the mistaken belief that if they're just polite enough and focus on restoring norms of decency and behavior that they can negotiate Republicans to a reasonable compromise."", ""I was thinking about the same topic last night and came to a more radical opinion:\n\nThe supreme court has been fundamentally broken and no longer acts within it's constitutional bounds as a result of increased court partisanship and the effective legislative nature of court decisions. As a result the court must be reformed or recreated, not fixed by the addition of judges. \n\nI am not exactly sure in what way I would re-create the court. There are numerous other constitutional courts for other democratic nations that we may be able to copy and adjust. The [French court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Council_(France) and the [German court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court) may be good places to start if you want some reading on how other countries manage, nether have lifetime appointments. Personally I really like the way that Germany does it. Judges require a 2/3 majority vote in the Bundestag (equivalent to the House of Representatives). There are also age and education requirements for the Judges in the German system. The German system has 12 year term with no re-election."", ""I agree in spirit but the sad fact is that the SCOTUS issue will fire up Trump's base and they will now have even more reason to go to the polls. Combined with voter suppression tactics & Russian propagandizing of the media, key Electoral College seats may stay in Trump's reach.

It will kick start a much needed reform to how we choose judges.Like most of you, I hate the position the Dems are in and the GOP screwed their way into. But we're here because of the politicized nature of the SCOTUS. The highest court in the land should not be used as a political tool. But that is exactly what it has become. I'm beginning to think that the only way to fix it is by burning down the house. Let the GOP ram through a nominee. If Trump wins in November, oh well, he would be seating the nominee anyways. If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts. The next trump could come in and pack the court even more, and so on, causing a runaway effect. Or, Congress on both sides decides the extreme bipartisanship is getting out of control and actually pass a reform that everyone agrees to.[""I haven't seen much over the last decade to think that the Democrats and specifically Biden would be willing to adopt those kind of aggressive tactics. They still seem to operate with the mistaken belief that if they're just polite enough and focus on restoring norms of decency and behavior that they can negotiate Republicans to a reasonable compromise."", ""I was thinking about the same topic last night and came to a more radical opinion:\n\nThe supreme court has been fundamentally broken and no longer acts within it's constitutional bounds as a result of increased court partisanship and the effective legislative nature of court decisions. As a result the court must be reformed or recreated, not fixed by the addition of judges. \n\nI am not exactly sure in what way I would re-create the court. There are numerous other constitutional courts for other democratic nations that we may be able to copy and adjust. The [French court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Council_(France) and the [German court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Constitutional_Court) may be good places to start if you want some reading on how other countries manage, nether have lifetime appointments. Personally I really like the way that Germany does it. Judges require a 2/3 majority vote in the Bundestag (equivalent to the House of Representatives). There are also age and education requirements for the Judges in the German system. The German system has 12 year term with no re-election."", ""I agree in spirit but the sad fact is that the SCOTUS issue will fire up Trump's base and they will now have even more reason to go to the polls. Combined with voter suppression tactics & Russian propagandizing of the media, key Electoral College seats may stay in Trump's reach. Also, this makes the Senate even harder to turn Blue if the GOP Senators close ranks behind this. We could end up with a real mess to sort out come the day after elections."", ""Maybe.

This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

Some are prevented from voting by voter suppression, but in general these are people who are not particularly well informed about politics and history, and their hodgepodge views reflect that.

Important PSA: Do not treat tear gas or pepper sprays with the following items,9,iuhl62,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iuhl62/important_psa_do_not_treat_tear_gas_or_pepper/,0,1600370865.0,"*This is taken from the book Riot Medicine, if you have any scientific data to contradict the information presented. I will add it.*

Note: RCA means Riot Control Agent, which is the technical term for things like tear gas and pepper spray.

* **LAW/Maalox:**   Liquid antacid and water (LAW) is a mixture of 50% liquid antacid and 50% water. In some countries, LAW is simply referred to as Maalox \[the name of a popular brand of liquid antacid.\] LAW is an extremely popular treatment, in part because of its simplicity and the minor cooling sensation patients report when LAW is applied to the skin. Liquid antacid does not belong in the eyes, and although rare, ingredients in antacids may cause an allergic reaction. Research on  pain relief provided by topical application of antacid is mixed. One study showed no significant decrease in pain for patients exposed to OC spray after applying liquid antacid. Another showed statistically significant decrease in pain up to the 60 minute mark, but Riot Control Agent   Contamination concluded “the difference in \[pain levels\] may have questionable clinical significance.” Anecdotal evidence supports the idea that LAW decreases pain for OC spray on the skin, but it is not recommended even if it is marginally more effective.
* **Baby Shampoo:**   Baby shampoo has not been shown to be effective when used in the eyes or on the skin for treating either pepper spray or tear gas.
* **FAST:** Fixative antacid surfactant treatment (FAST) is a pepper spray remedy originally published on It’s Going Down. FAST was de-signed to be a more effective alternative to LAW that combined the active ingredients of antacid, sunflower lecithin, and baby shampoo. While there was some   experimentation done by the creators to determine whether this treatment was effective, it lacked the rigor be make conclusions. More generally, research on the individual active ingredients suggests that they do not  provide a statistically significant decrease in pain.
* **Cow's Milk:** Plain cow’s milk is another common treatment for pepper spray and tear gas. Pouring milk into the eyes has risk of infection, and this is especially true on hot days where the milk will not remain refrigerated before use. The stickiness and stench of milk is another downside of using milk as a decontaminant. Most importantly, cow’s milk used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been show to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Oils:** Mineral oil followed immediately by alcohol (MOFIBA) is an outdated treatment for pepper spray contamination that is no longer used by most medics. The treatment worked by covering small patches of skin with mineral oil to attract pepper spray, then removing it with rubbing   alcohol. This was retired from use because if done incorrectly can cause additional pain over pepper spray alone. Similarly, people have used vegetable oil to wash the affected area, wiping the residue off after, and this should not be done either. Both of these methods are harmful because oil will trap the RCA against the skin.
* **Onions:** Onions have been inaccurately reported as effective against tear gas. This belief seems to be most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa. The reported procedure is to breath over whole or cut onions, and in particular to use onions themselves as part of improvised gas masks to mitigate the effects of inhaling tear gas. RCAs, and in particular tear gas, are lachrymators.  Chopped onion releases a chemical which is also a lachrymator. Onions do not mitigate or prevent   the effects of tear gas.
* **Vinegar:** Vinegar is another commonly suggested ineffective remedy and preventative measure for tear gas inhalation. Activists suggest using it as a decontaminant on affected skin. It has been suggested to soak a bandana in vinegar then breath through it to prevent inhalation of tear gas.  Like tear gas, vinegar is a lachrymator. Vinegar vapor irritates the eyes, and prolonged inhalation will irritate the lungs.
* **Citrus:** Lemon and lime have been suggested to be used like vinegar, both as a decontaminant wash for the skin and with a bandana as a filter for tear gas. There is no evidence either of these have any effect on reducing the irritation associated with tear gas or preventing inhalation.
* **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Hydrogen peroxide is another remedy used by activists and medics to treat tear gas and pepper spray. There is no evidence that this has any effect on either, and further, it will cause additional burning sensations if it gets into the eyes or other mucous membranes. Given   that pepper spray is mainly aimed at the face and tear gas affects the eyes, nose, and mouth, there is high risk of causing additional harm to the patient even if it was an effective treatment.
* **Lidocaine:** Lidocaine in particular when used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been shown to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Miscellaneous:** Some activists have suggested a variety of treatments such as using baking soda paste, topical analgesics, or toothpaste to treat affected areas. These are not recommended as they trap RCAs against the skin and may worsen its effects.

I would strongly suggest you read Riot Medicine's section on RCAs to help  deal with protection and treatment. But I'll provide a summary.

**Protection**

Typically protesters will use goggles and a half-mask respirator or disposable respirator. If these are not available, a hat, glasses, and bandana will still offer a moderate amount of protection. A wet bandana made of a fabric with a tight weave held over the mouth will filter a modest mount of tear gas from the air.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that slow, shallow breaths helps minimize the effects of tear gas on the lungs. Patients have reported feeling the immediate urge to vomit after taking deep breaths in the presence of tear gas and that the feeling persisted until they were able to spend significant time breathing fresh air.

**Treatment**

In general, use water or saline (Manufactured salt water used for medical purposes)

* If you're helping others, introduce yourself first and obtain consent to help, if they are unable to give consent. Do not force treatment onto people. If someone is unconscious you can assume consent, but you have bigger problems to deal with than RCAs.
* Remove yourself/the patient from the area the gas or spray is to an area with fresh air to prevent further damage.
* Do not touch the affected areas.
* Allow tear and mucus production, and allow coughing and sneezing. If you or the patient is asthmatic, use an inhaler.
* Remove and clean contact lenses, possibly dispose of them.
* Decontamination: If it's CR, attempt to brush and dust off as much as possible. Avoid use of water or other liquids to decontaminate the patient unless they are already wet or sweaty, or the RCA is in their eyes (which are  already wet). If not, flush the body part with large amounts of water. For parts of the body other than the eyes, spraying large amounts of water on the affected body part is sufficient.
* Rinse the mouth. Even in the absence of burning or irritating sensations in the mouth, it still helps.

My Dad for example, is an intelligent and compassionate man, but he is also a devout Christian and is unable to separate church from state.  He is well-studied in multiple areas of science, but when presented with proven scientific facts that don’t jive with his religious beliefs, he denies them, saying the studies were flawed, or funded by biased groups or individuals.

He supports Trump and says he is voting to re-elect the president because “He has kept all of his promises,” and “he’s bringing jobs and God back to America.”

My Dad has always shown respect for women and minorities, but he doesn’t mind that Trump is openly opposite in those areas.

There is no cost to the municipality. Previously, the volunteer EMS unit did not bill anyone for the ambulance ride.

Who doesn't get paid through the city? \n\nDepends on the city, but in New York City, for example, the Fire Department runs the ambulances. The EMTs and paramedics are paid members of FDNY.

Some EMS units are their own distinct agency. \n\nNow, in my area, volunteer firefighters are a fully functioning operation providing for fewer than a thousand runs a year. EMS, however, runs closer to three thousand. They eventually couldn't keep up and the municipality now contracts with a private ambulance service run by a hospital. *That* agency bills your insurance company for the ambulance trip, as they own and operate everything from the ambulances to the EMTs and paramedics that staff them. There is no cost to the municipality. Previously, the volunteer EMS unit did not bill anyone for the ambulance ride. They were funded by donations from the community for fuel, supplies, training, etc.\n\nSo in answer to your question, the people involved in handling and transporting patients are usually volunteers and if paid, are often  not paid well (sometimes they are paid well).

Therefore, anyone that doesn\'t believe in using force to take money from one group of people to give to another group of people, doesn\'t belive in ""rights."" it\'s a clever ploy, and has been very effective across the developed world.\n\nThe same bait and switch tactic is now happening with Feminism (replacing ""women are the equals of men"" to ""there\'s no such thing as biological sex"") and Racism (replacing ""prejudice based on skin color"" with ""collective blame based on historical events"" aka ""power plus privikafe"").', ""I grew up in the Midwest, have lived on both coasts, and know lots of people of all political orientations. Absolutely no one that I've ever met wants to undo the Civil rights movement or revoke women's equal rights. I even know some people that are loud and proud racists, and even they don't want to undo the Civil rights movement.\n\nI actually don't see progressives pushing for anything that I would call rights. They're pushing for more power to be centralized in Washington DC. Progressives want to nationalize medicine, now that they're done nationalizing the student debt market (that's going great, right?) and they already failed trying to nationalize the housing debt market (Fanny, Freddy, 2008. Yikes.).\n\nBut worse yet, they're pushing for people to strongly associate their identity & politics to their race. This is insanity, and seems to be making peaceful coexistence between ethnic groups more and more challenging."", ""Seems like people are gearing up! \n\nBut, quite frankly, I'm not putting Biden signs in my yard because, unfortunately, I'd feel like my home would end up a target in these times. I'm smack dab in a rural red area full of T cultists."", 'It sure will, along with any other Mainstream media group (including Fox). The way they get their revenue is views. The way they get views is by keeping people glued to the TV by presenting constant threats that people have no power to fix themselves. The way they out-compete internet media is through privileged access to DC politicians. The news outlet picks a party to ally themselves with, and spouts their propaganda in exchange for exclusive interviews.', 'Well they\'ve done a bang-up job of getting other ""real"" conservatives on board, haven\'t they?! Republicans are now all-in as the party of Trump, and share all the dishonor that implies. Also, those ""think tanks"" maybe took the name a bit literally, because I didn\'t see a whole lot of them trying to dissuade the Bush admin from invading Iraq or Afghanistan back in the day. It sure seems like even the intellectual conservatives are devoid of empathy, and unable to recognise or accept that a rising tide lifts all vessels, and that we\'re all in this together, whether we like it or not. Republican policy has been disastrous for decades now, unless you happen to be in the 1%, or aspire to be regardless of consequences for everyone around you.', 'Or not.', 'So when was that perfect time when we actually had individual rights for all?\n\nI think you confuse ""we realize these battles can\'t be eon yet"" with ""we agree with the side that won.""', ""Who says that Conservatism and the Republican party have anything to do with one another? The party wasn't founded by conservatives (it was founded by abolitionists), and isn't run by conservatives today. Just like the Democrats aren't run by people who are liberal (in the original meaning of the word). Parties don't represent an ideology, they are just the political equivalent of companies."", ""Right now we have individual rights for all. Many people don't seem to use their rights very well, but until they break the law they have all the same rights as everyone else. This may not keep forever, as in California, progressives have amended the state constitution to make it legal to descriminate against people based on their skin color so they can enact Social Justice."", 'Well these conservatives sure do spout a lot of the same talking points as the apparently-totally-unrelated Republicans! What a coincidence...\n\nHere are some quotes I\'ve just pulled from the Heritage Foundation\'s [front page](https://www.heritage.org/):\n\n> Why the Electoral College Is so Necessary\n\n> As the presidential election draws nearer, leftist leaders have grown bolder in their calls to fundamentally change America’s electoral system by abolishing the Electoral College. Experts at The Heritage Foundation have produced an engage\xa0guide\xa0that explain why this\xa0would be disastrous.\n\nDastardly *leftists* and their calls for people\'s votes to matter, amirite?! Or how about this one:\n\n> Mail-In Voting and Voter Fraud: What You Need to Know\n\n> Should you trust the mail with your vote? Why is voting-by-mail so vulnerable to fraud and abuse? How concerned should you be about your ballot getting lost or rejected? While many on the left say we should just ignore evidence of voter fraud and weaknesses within the mail-in voting system, election experts say we shouldn’t dismiss it.\n\nI don\'t recall anyone on the left saying we should ignore evidence of voter fraud, let alone *many*, but maybe my undeveloped *leftist* brain just **cancelled** that info, like a good leftist brain does... \n\nSeriously mate, defending ""conservatism"" as if it\'s some beacon of light in a mad world, and *not* just another smokescreen for batshit Republican policy, is just fakery. What the fuck benefit has conservatism ever provided? Again, besides to the 1%, I mean. Even then, bank balances don\'t help your offspring much when you\'ve destroyed the planet they\'ll inherit. Put the Kool-aid down mate, and join the right side of history.', 'I actually haven\'t forwarded a single argument in favor of conservatism, and I am in fact not a conservative. All I\'ve done is offer corrections when they are being misrepresented.\n\nConservatism is basically the idea that ""this thing works. I don\'t fully understand why it works, but I\'m going to try to make sure it doesn\'t break."" so, Conservatism is beneficial when there is something that is complicated, and really shouldn\'t break. 2 good examples: the environment, and the economy.\n\nEnvironmentalsim should really be understood as a conservative (even reactionary) movement that seeks to prevent change to the environment, because it is so complicated and so fragile that any radical change could spell catastrophe. \n\nThe economy can also thought of as being like the environment: it operates as a complex, nonlinear system. The knowledge of prices, supplies, changes in technology, etc are spread out across all of civilization. Therefore giving enormous power to one small group of people, and giving them power to radically change the system could spell catastrophe.\n\nSo, conservatism isn\'t about the 1%, or markets per se, or religion. It\'s just about not assuming you can dream up exactly how society should be (re)structured through sheer brainpower.\n\nThis attitude works well in some cases, and flounders in others. The trick is to figure that out, not to dismiss whole schools of thought and glom onto one. Marrying yourself to one ideology, one lens to see the world, is like choosing to see the world without color. So, you can save the kool-aid, it looks like you might need it; you can share it with your ""right side of history"" buddies.', '>I actually haven\'t forwarded a single argument in favor of conservatism, and I am in fact not a conservative. All I\'ve done is offer corrections when they are being misrepresented.\n\nSo just JAQing off then. \n\n>Conservatism is basically the idea that ""this thing works. I don\'t fully understand why it works, but I\'m going to try to make sure it doesn\'t break."" so, Conservatism is beneficial when there is something that is complicated, and really shouldn\'t break. 2 good examples: the environment, and the economy.\n\nSo the idea is paternalistic and flawed from the start, because that whole ""this thing works"" is incorrect, as it demonstrably does not. Again, unless you\'re a wealthy white man. Conservative policies have failed to manage both the economy and protect the environment, so I don\'t know why you think you\'re making sense. \n\n>Environmentalsim should really be understood as a conservative (even reactionary) movement that seeks to prevent change to the environment, because it is so complicated and so fragile that any radical change could spell catastrophe. \n\nOK, I guess, but it\'s not being aided by the ""real conservatives\'"" policies, is it? Show me an abundance of AEI, Heritage Foundation, and/or Cato Institute study where those supah-smaht conservatives put forward policy that aims to actually conserve *the fucking environment* and not just industry\'s bottom line, and your argument might stand a chance. I imagine you\'ll be looking for quite a while. Hell, even if you find something, it obviously had no effect on those dastardly fake conservatives that are actually in power, cos we\'ve never had a sensible environmental policy under them, probably since as far back as when that hippie Nixon created the EPA. \n\n>The economy can also thought of as being like the environment: it operates as a complex, nonlinear system. The knowledge of prices, supplies, changes in technology, etc are spread out across all of civilization. Therefore giving enormous power to one small group of people, and giving them power to radically change the system could spell catastrophe.\n\nBy a small group, do you mean like if, say, 1% of the world\'s population held almost all the wealth? I agree, it\'d be fucking terrible. Glad that\'s not the case, eh? Actually hol\'up.... \n\n>So, conservatism isn\'t about the 1%, or markets per se, or religion. It\'s just about not assuming you can dream up exactly how society should be (re)structured through sheer brainpower.\n\nAny change presents unknowns and therefore a risk, but if and when that risk seems to be outweighed by the danger of *not* changing course, then it\'s obvious that one should choose the non-conservative option. Anyone that says otherwise lives in a fantasy world, and is not even remotely pragmatic. \n\n>This attitude works well in some cases, and flounders in others. The trick is to figure that out, not to dismiss whole schools of thought and glom onto one. \n\nI entirely agree. Yet, I don\'t see any sensible policy from conservatives (*real* or otherwise), ever. \n\n> Marrying yourself to one ideology, one lens to see the world, is like choosing to see the world without color. So, you can save the kool-aid, it looks like you might need it; you can share it with your ""right side of history"" buddies.\n\nThere are certainly some troubling issues with a few leftists too, most concerning of which probably being their seeming inability to allow discussion of difficult but necessary topics for fear of not seeming woke enough, which is asinine. That said, they\'re typically trying to advance us to the the aforementioned right side of history (you know, with more equality, less poverty, better access to Healthcare, a whole that will hopefully persist beyond only a couple generations, etc).

Countering Bad Faith Argument About Child Abuse During Covid,38,im11kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/im11kf/countering_bad_faith_argument_about_child_abuse/,5,1599192339.0,"One of the arguments I'm hearing right now that I find utterly infuriating is that stay-at-home orders and the partial shutdowns the United States has been enacting on a state-by-state basis will contribute to putting more children in danger of abuse because they'll be at home more in stressful situations and won't have access to mandatory reporters like teachers.

This infuriates me because it often comes from people who make no reasonable efforts to counter child abuse at other times and it's clearly being made in bad faith, ""Won't somebody think of the children!?!"" but has enough logic behind it that I find it difficult to counter intellectually.

I do believe that local, state, and the federal governments should be taking this into consideration and providing resources to help mitigate the issue, but I also don't think it's in any way a justification for sending children back to school or into other potentially dangerous situations which could spread covid.

Why isn't the progressive platform pushing harder for ranked choice voting?,133,ihjj44,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/ihjj44/why_isnt_the_progressive_platform_pushing_harder/,36,1598557581.0,"Hey everyone, I hear talks about the creation of a new ""progressive party"" to house the likes of Bernie Sanders, AOC, and others, but I can't help but feel this plan is dead in the water in America as it stands. The way the voting system works ensures the existence of massive, monolithic parties that everyone has to settle for. Ranked choice voting would make it so smaller parties could actually win elections and grow support. In early 2020, I didn't see any candidates (besides Yang) push for RCV on their platform. Is there any reason for this?",Progressive,"['Ranked-choice is a crucial reform to make our elections objectively better because it captures more information about each voter\'s will. If you like democracy, then you should like ranked-choice voting because it is MORE DEMOCRATIC.\n\nRanked-choice would certainly help progressive candidates in some situations. Consider a person during the 2020 primary whose first choice was Sanders or Warren, but who was forced, in their mind, to vote for their second choice, Biden, because they deemed him most ""electable"". Under ranked-choice, the voter would rank Sanders or Warren first, and rank Biden second (accurately reflecting their preference). The progressive candidate would get the vote, and the voter would be confident that even if Warren or Sanders was eliminated, their overall preference for at least a Democrat like Biden would be counted by the system.\n\nAnd it wouldn\'t only help progressives. Consider the 2016 Republican primaries that elected Trump. Many, maybe even most, Republicans viewed Trump as their LAST choice Republican nominee for president. But there were a dozen other candidates and millions of Republicans ended up dividing their votes among them. So Trump received the plurality of votes (more than any other candidate) and won the election even though, again, he may have been most Republican primaries voters\' last choice. Ranked-choice would have more accurately captured those voters\' preferences and would have prevented Trump from being chosen unless he truly was the majority\'s choice (which I [doubt](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html)).\n\nSo it\'s not that ranked-choice is better for one side or another. It\'s better for EVERYONE who cares about democracy because it MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE WILL OF VOTERS.\n\nAND it\'s better for movements trying to change society because when movements successfully move people\'s opinions, ranked-choice more accurately reflects it. Think of all of the progressive policies [clearly supported](https://www.dataforprogress.org/polling-the-left-agenda) by the [majority of Americans](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/poll-marijuana-legalization-data-for-progress-radical-ideas-popular-aoc.html) ($15 minimum wage, Medicare For All, Rx drug price reform, mandatory full-day kindergarten, paid child care, paid family and medical leave, stopping global warming, and many others), but which continually fail to pass Congress. Since ranked-choice ensures no candidate is elected with less than majority support, it would move the needle on these majority-supported solutions much faster.\n\nOur current election system captures exactly one piece of information about your voting preference: your top choice. If your top choice isn\'t one of the top performing-candidate, your vote simply doesn\'t count. Or you might hold your nose and vote for someone you don\'t really like---but in democracy, no one should have to do that. The ranked-choice system solves it by capturing your preference for candidates in ranked order. That is a lot more information about your preferences, so your preferences will have more impact on the results of the election.\n\nTo be MOST democratic, it seems to me that ranked-choice voting should be paired with open/nonpartisan top-four primaries. The combination is a powerful reform of our democracy and doing both solves many problems. \n\nSee this interesting report, page 6, where I saw this pairing proposed: [https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf)', ""Ranked choice voting isn't amazing. Proportional representation is the real moneymaker to me. Give people a reason to vote for different parties, because they will actually get in."", ""If we want ranked choice voting, we can try to pass it next year, but what's the point of putting it in the platform? How many votes will it win us? Platforms don't mean anything anyway. Nobody reads them and leaders don't follow them after the election. The GOP isn't even bothering with one this time."", 'OP, I think you will find this report interesting if you haven\'t seen it. It applies an economic lens to analyze ""competition"" in U.S. politics (that\'s competition as in between businesses in an industry). It finds that the parties have monopolies on power and recommends ranked-choice voting among its solutions. [https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf)', 'The politicians paradox. Why should I reform the system when the system got me elected?', ""Sanders and AOC managed to get elected already...\n\nI don't think RVC on it's own would help as much in the US: Competitive primaries are already an option an a way for somebody like AOC to challenge a more moderate Democratic incumbent. It probably *would* be better to just have a single election with RVC then the two-stage system, but I'm not sure how big that difference is.\n\nIn something like a Presidential election you also have primaries, but more importantly it wouldn't change anything. Even with RVC, you can't afford to vote for a third party candidate for President because if they win *your state* that's really bad. You had to have some kind of national-level RVC, but that requires deeper changes to the EC I think."", 'Maybe they are worried the average person is already too worried about their vote just counting during this election.', ""An end to FPTP would give me more options, and that's what I want at this juncture. The trajectory of the past two elections has been...well, not great."", 'Because we suck sometimes', 'We have to fix regular voting first. If electoral fraud (not vote fraud) wasn\'t such a problem, we could look at other options. Right now it\'s considered ""progressive"" to want to let people of color and liberals in general to both vote, and to have their votes counted.', 'Personally I like the [""Jungle Primary""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary). This system is known under multiple names: jungle primary, nonpartisan blanket primary, the french system. \n\nIn a jungle primary all candidates that meet certain basic requirements (signatures collected, paperwork, etc.). All candidates appear on a primary ballot regardless of party. Voting commences and the top two candidates run off with the others eliminated. The candidate that wins the runoff wins. \n\nDisadvantage of this system: If the 4th or 3rd place candidate would have won in a ranked choice system that\'s not so good. Rebuttal: the 3rd or 4th place candidate winning is unlikely. Look at the CA house elections (that are run with this system) and see how far behind the 3rd or 4th place usually are. \n\nAdvantage: The final two candidates are able to argue against a particular candidate, as opposed to a field. \n\nThere is an argument (my argument) that this system, when compared to ranked choice, has less potential for election fraud. The most common form of election fraud is moving votes from one candidate to the other. This form of fraud results in statistically unexpected close races and is hard to detect because the total votes remain the same. Ranked choice as a system moves votes from one candidate to the next thus, in my mind, creates the possibility for fraud to take place during that system.', 'I think Alaska is voting to implement this exact combo: RCV + top 4 primaries...hope it passes so we can see how it works', ""100% this, however, we should still be pushing for ranked choice voting as a step in the right direction. Obviously there is much more we could do, but don't fall into the trap that progress isn't worth making unless it progresses enough. Ranked choice alone likely would have changed the outcome in 2016 and that's a start."", 'lobby for your states to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact', 'Ranked-choice is a way to significantly improve things without switching to proportional representation. See my comment elsewhere on this thread. But it also probably the best voting system for jurisdictions with proportional representation. See this: https://www.fairvote.org/rcv', 'Not much chance of amending the constitution any time soon, so proportional is pie in the sky.', 'Well, generally, I think the progressive strategy has shifted to a more ""from the ground up"" approach. Where we are electing real progressives from the smallest levels of government up. I\'d think in this scenario, RCV would be ideal. I could support my local socialist mayor, while not risking splitting the Democrat vote, electing a Republican, and causing things to get worse.', 'Will give it a read, thanks.', ""That's an interesting idea but I could see some issues with this. Say one party has 2 people that each get 20% of the vote. The other party has 5 people that split their part of the vote more and end up with 10-15% each. This way we end up with two similar candidates from the same party that received less of the total vote but they are the only choice left."", 'I think the jungle primary is pretty cool, in part because it eliminates the role of parties in elections. I\'ve seen my party (democrat) be a roadblock rather than a pathway to progressivism and majority-supported progressive policies in so many situations, that I\'m all for voting systems that reduce their stranglehold on the process. It seems like a profound change for the good to me, actually.\n\nBut a few things about it. 1) It seems better to advance [four candidates to the general election, not two](https://fairvote.app.box.com/v/TopFourRCVPolicyGuide). In part, because the general election is when most people participate and having greater choice for them at that time is more democratic. A candidate who comes in third or fourth in the general might be more viable the general, for example, because more young people, parents, and working people participate in the general election. Overall it\'s just more democratic if more people have more choices. 2) It should use ranked-choice voting in the general election between the four candidates, for all the benefits of that system, such as a) being the least manipulatable the voting system (through tactical voting) and allowing voters to vote their conscience, b) preventing the spoiler effect, and c) being ""[an antidote to the disease of negative campaigning](http://archive.fairvote.org/oaklandirv/webarchive/russo.html)"" (because no candidate want to alienate the supporters of other candidates)).\n\nAlso, I think that in the primary, it might also be possible to use ranked-choice voting to select the four candidates through a system called [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote). I\'m not sure if that is exactly appropriate for a jungle primary, but there are certainly ways to used ranked-choice to elect multiple candidates and I suspect that would be preferable in the primary too.\n\nThis system would still have the straightforward and open aspects of the jungle primary in that all candidates would run in a single race regardless of party and any voter could participate, regardless of party.', 'How exciting! It makes a lot of sense to have four running in the general when more voters participate (compared to primaries) and can have a say. I hope this spreads.', ""Does ranked choice actually change much? From what I've read it makes the two party system even more solidly in power."", ""I think RCV is a good idea and also agree that progressives need to elect like minded people to local offices, and not put so much stock in the POTUS elections, but platforms don't mean shit.

I'd put these pet issues away until after the election and concentrate on what will us win power right now."", ""True, there is an example of a simmular situation with the Washington state treasurer. However it is arguable that a party that can't unite behind one candidate lacked a unified ideology."", ""That happens already sometimes in areas where one party's voters outnumber the other 2:1 or more.

The way the voting system works ensures the existence of massive, monolithic parties that everyone has to settle for. Ranked choice voting would make it so smaller parties could actually win elections and grow support. In early 2020, I didn't see any candidates (besides Yang) push for RCV on their platform. Is there any reason for this?['Ranked-choice is a crucial reform to make our elections objectively better because it captures more information about each voter\'s will. If you like democracy, then you should like ranked-choice voting because it is MORE DEMOCRATIC.\n\nRanked-choice would certainly help progressive candidates in some situations. Consider a person during the 2020 primary whose first choice was Sanders or Warren, but who was forced, in their mind, to vote for their second choice, Biden, because they deemed him most ""electable"". Under ranked-choice, the voter would rank Sanders or Warren first, and rank Biden second (accurately reflecting their preference). The progressive candidate would get the vote, and the voter would be confident that even if Warren or Sanders was eliminated, their overall preference for at least a Democrat like Biden would be counted by the system.\n\nAnd it wouldn\'t only help progressives. Consider the 2016 Republican primaries that elected Trump. Many, maybe even most, Republicans viewed Trump as their LAST choice Republican nominee for president. But there were a dozen other candidates and millions of Republicans ended up dividing their votes among them. So Trump received the plurality of votes (more than any other candidate) and won the election even though, again, he may have been most Republican primaries voters\' last choice. Ranked-choice would have more accurately captured those voters\' preferences and would have prevented Trump from being chosen unless he truly was the majority\'s choice (which I [doubt](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/08/01/us/elections/nine-percent-of-america-selected-trump-and-clinton.html)).\n\nSo it\'s not that ranked-choice is better for one side or another. It\'s better for EVERYONE who cares about democracy because it MORE ACCURATELY REFLECTS THE WILL OF VOTERS.\n\nAND it\'s better for movements trying to change society because when movements successfully move people\'s opinions, ranked-choice more accurately reflects it. Think of all of the progressive policies [clearly supported](https://www.dataforprogress.org/polling-the-left-agenda) by the [majority of Americans](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/08/poll-marijuana-legalization-data-for-progress-radical-ideas-popular-aoc.html) ($15 minimum wage, Medicare For All, Rx drug price reform, mandatory full-day kindergarten, paid child care, paid family and medical leave, stopping global warming, and many others), but which continually fail to pass Congress. Since ranked-choice ensures no candidate is elected with less than majority support, it would move the needle on these majority-supported solutions much faster.\n\nOur current election system captures exactly one piece of information about your voting preference: your top choice. If your top choice isn\'t one of the top performing-candidate, your vote simply doesn\'t count. Or you might hold your nose and vote for someone you don\'t really like---but in democracy, no one should have to do that. The ranked-choice system solves it by capturing your preference for candidates in ranked order. That is a lot more information about your preferences, so your preferences will have more impact on the results of the election.\n\nTo be MOST democratic, it seems to me that ranked-choice voting should be paired with open/nonpartisan top-four primaries. The combination is a powerful reform of our democracy and doing both solves many problems. \n\nSee this interesting report, page 6, where I saw this pairing proposed: [https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf)', ""Ranked choice voting isn't amazing. Proportional representation is the real moneymaker to me. Give people a reason to vote for different parties, because they will actually get in."", ""If we want ranked choice voting, we can try to pass it next year, but what's the point of putting it in the platform? How many votes will it win us? Platforms don't mean anything anyway. Nobody reads them and leaders don't follow them after the election. The GOP isn't even bothering with one this time."", 'OP, I think you will find this report interesting if you haven\'t seen it. It applies an economic lens to analyze ""competition"" in U.S. politics (that\'s competition as in between businesses in an industry). It finds that the parties have monopolies on power and recommends ranked-choice voting among its solutions. [https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf](https://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/Documents/why-competition-in-the-politics-industry-is-failing-america.pdf)', 'The politicians paradox. Why should I reform the system when the system got me elected?', ""Sanders and AOC managed to get elected already...\n\nI don't think RVC on it's own would help as much in the US: Competitive primaries are already an option an a way for somebody like AOC to challenge a more moderate Democratic incumbent. It probably *would* be better to just have a single election with RVC then the two-stage system, but I'm not sure how big that difference is.\n\nIn something like a Presidential election you also have primaries, but more importantly it wouldn't change anything. Even with RVC, you can't afford to vote for a third party candidate for President because if they win *your state* that's really bad. You had to have some kind of national-level RVC, but that requires deeper changes to the EC I think."", 'Maybe they are worried the average person is already too worried about their vote just counting during this election.', ""An end to FPTP would give me more options, and that's what I want at this juncture. The trajectory of the past two elections has been...well, not great."", 'Because we suck sometimes', 'We have to fix regular voting first. If electoral fraud (not vote fraud) wasn\'t such a problem, we could look at other options. Right now it\'s considered ""progressive"" to want to let people of color and liberals in general to both vote, and to have their votes counted.', 'Personally I like the [""Jungle Primary""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_blanket_primary). This system is known under multiple names: jungle primary, nonpartisan blanket primary, the french system. \n\nIn a jungle primary all candidates that meet certain basic requirements (signatures collected, paperwork, etc.). All candidates appear on a primary ballot regardless of party. Voting commences and the top two candidates run off with the others eliminated. The candidate that wins the runoff wins. \n\nDisadvantage of this system: If the 4th or 3rd place candidate would have won in a ranked choice system that\'s not so good. Rebuttal: the 3rd or 4th place candidate winning is unlikely. Look at the CA house elections (that are run with this system) and see how far behind the 3rd or 4th place usually are. \n\nAdvantage: The final two candidates are able to argue against a particular candidate, as opposed to a field. \n\nThere is an argument (my argument) that this system, when compared to ranked choice, has less potential for election fraud. The most common form of election fraud is moving votes from one candidate to the other. This form of fraud results in statistically unexpected close races and is hard to detect because the total votes remain the same. Ranked choice as a system moves votes from one candidate to the next thus, in my mind, creates the possibility for fraud to take place during that system.', 'I think Alaska is voting to implement this exact combo: RCV + top 4 primaries...hope it passes so we can see how it works', ""100% this, however, we should still be pushing for ranked choice voting as a step in the right direction. Obviously there is much more we could do, but don't fall into the trap that progress isn't worth making unless it progresses enough. Ranked choice alone likely would have changed the outcome in 2016 and that's a start."", 'lobby for your states to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact', 'Ranked-choice is a way to significantly improve things without switching to proportional representation. See my comment elsewhere on this thread. But it also probably the best voting system for jurisdictions with proportional representation. See this: https://www.fairvote.org/rcv', 'Not much chance of amending the constitution any time soon, so proportional is pie in the sky.', 'Well, generally, I think the progressive strategy has shifted to a more ""from the ground up"" approach. Where we are electing real progressives from the smallest levels of government up. I\'d think in this scenario, RCV would be ideal. I could support my local socialist mayor, while not risking splitting the Democrat vote, electing a Republican, and causing things to get worse.', 'Will give it a read, thanks.', ""That's an interesting idea but I could see some issues with this. Say one party has 2 people that each get 20% of the vote. The other party has 5 people that split their part of the vote more and end up with 10-15% each. This way we end up with two similar candidates from the same party that received less of the total vote but they are the only choice left."", 'I think the jungle primary is pretty cool, in part because it eliminates the role of parties in elections. I\'ve seen my party (democrat) be a roadblock rather than a pathway to progressivism and majority-supported progressive policies in so many situations, that I\'m all for voting systems that reduce their stranglehold on the process. It seems like a profound change for the good to me, actually.\n\nBut a few things about it. 1) It seems better to advance [four candidates to the general election, not two](https://fairvote.app.box.com/v/TopFourRCVPolicyGuide). In part, because the general election is when most people participate and having greater choice for them at that time is more democratic. A candidate who comes in third or fourth in the general might be more viable the general, for example, because more young people, parents, and working people participate in the general election. Overall it\'s just more democratic if more people have more choices. 2) It should use ranked-choice voting in the general election between the four candidates, for all the benefits of that system, such as a) being the least manipulatable the voting system (through tactical voting) and allowing voters to vote their conscience, b) preventing the spoiler effect, and c) being ""[an antidote to the disease of negative campaigning](http://archive.fairvote.org/oaklandirv/webarchive/russo.html)"" (because no candidate want to alienate the supporters of other candidates)).\n\nAlso, I think that in the primary, it might also be possible to use ranked-choice voting to select the four candidates through a system called [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote). I\'m not sure if that is exactly appropriate for a jungle primary, but there are certainly ways to used ranked-choice to elect multiple candidates and I suspect that would be preferable in the primary too.\n\nThis system would still have the straightforward and open aspects of the jungle primary in that all candidates would run in a single race regardless of party and any voter could participate, regardless of party.', 'How exciting! It makes a lot of sense to have four running in the general when more voters participate (compared to primaries) and can have a say. I hope this spreads.', ""Does ranked choice actually change much? From what I've read it makes the two party system even more solidly in power."", ""I think RCV is a good idea and also agree that progressives need to elect like minded people to local offices, and not put so much stock in the POTUS elections, but platforms don't mean shit. It isn't going to help elect Biden with majorities in both Houses. That's all that matters right now. I'd put these pet issues away until after the election and concentrate on what will us win power right now."", ""True, there is an example of a simmular situation with the Washington state treasurer. However it is arguable that a party that can't unite behind one candidate lacked a unified ideology."", ""That happens already sometimes in areas where one party's voters outnumber the other 2:1 or more.

When did they start thinking it's OK to inject anyone without their permission?"", 'Can we start using drugs to subdue the police? \n\nThat’s a serious question. Watch any cam footage, the cops are flipping out *at least* as often as the citizen is, if not more.  Escalating violence and increasing danger to all on the scene.\n\nCan we use drugs to subdue cops?', ""This is a really dangerous drug. It's not a sedative as we commonly think of it, in the sense that the person feels relaxed and falls asleep. They stop moving with their eyes open. They can't change position if they're unable to breathe properly or anything. Whether or not it's used to treat depression in small doses has nothing to do with the fact that it's being used to immobilize someone for the convenience of arresting officers, not in a healthcare setting where the person can be monitored. That paramedics would take orders from cops is very disturbing."", '> Those in favor of ketamine cite its fast-acting and short-lived effects as well as scientific reports that it doesn’t cause severe respiratory problems compared with other sedatives.\n\n\nYea, well, how about absolutely no drugs should be used to subdue an individual for arrest.', ""Police are not medical professionals and should never be allowed to inject anyone with drugs.  \n\nEdit: My bad... they're not. Paramedics are. I'm not technically wrong though haha"", 'New??', ""TF would ketamine be used as a means of arrest?  \n\n\nWho would ever think that's okay?"", 'Keep the peace, Yoda must.', 'Talk about a trip from hell.  Why not throw some LSD in there too.

Lol. They'll inject you with whatever they want, even if it will cause an allergic reaction."", 'I meant during an arrest.', ""Uhhh what?? No. I was in a psych ward for 5 days. You can refuse any drug if you're conscious. And if you're not you can't consent, they wake you up. If your unconscious for reasons other than sleep you get transferred to the medical part of the hospital to treat whatever the fuck is making you unconscious. HOWEVER, if you start, for no reason, refusing EVERYTHING or most things, they may consider committing you for a time. I actively worked with the psychiatrist nurses and told them how I felt and that I specifically didn't want X drug or a drug that had Y effect. What's more likely is them NOT giving you everything you're previously prescribed as a couple other patients had. This is t the 1950s or 90s or even 2000s anymore."", 'Lol! You actually think they care about legality?', ""I can back this up. I worked on psych wards, on locked units, along with nurses, doctors and other staff and although there are horrid people in the field it is not the norm. \n\nI've also been a patient, oddly enough, on the same unit I had previously worked on.\n\nGenerally speaking unless the patient has educated themselves on their rights they aren't aware they even can refuse certain treatments, or that if they do they can be noted as being 'uncooperative' with their treatment plan, and that can signal their vulture like insurance companies that their may be a loophole they can sliver through to avoid paying, IF they do at all. Sorry this is so long! Peace!  ☮"", 'Wow! You can just be quiet.', 'Yup, this adds to what I was saying. My specific hospital was good except for one tech (dude that checks where people are and takes blood pressure) that tried to fight a patient for ""disrespecting"" him. The other hospital in my area I heard was horrid. The legality isn\'t the issue. It\'s just the quality of the hospital. I loved my stay, I needed it, badly. Others didn\'t cuz they felt trapped. My nurses worked with me when I was extremely hesitant about addictive meds. They did note in my chart that I was somatic (and I really fucking was), but that\'s it.\n\nEdit: sorry for the edit adding this. Me and two other patients helped the patient that the tech tried to fight get a patient advocate. Sure he was troublemaker but no healthcare professional can just ask a patient to fight for hurting your feelings.', ""Well stop scaring people out of getting help. If your only option is to go to the hospital and it is for many people, and you're making them not do it, what do you think happens? Also, these medicine dispensers cross references your medical records for allergies and interactions."", ""You're disgusting! I was barely concious!"", ""Were you a danger to yourself or others? (No you don't have to actually answer) if so, they can do what they need to do. Allergies don't have time to be checked in an emergency. If it was an OD, they, again have a duty to help.

Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well.

A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort.

Pro- choice people don\'t want more abortions, they want fewer unwanted pregnancies, hence their insistance on sex education and affordable birth control. And when, in spite of it all, an unwanted pregnancy still occurs, then should abortion be an option. Anti-choice people often accuse people of opposite views of wishing for abortions, which is at best a misunderstanding and at worst a deliberate slur.

Win - Win.', 'It’s not bad, but I don’t like using arguments that makes an assumption about someone else’s frame of mind or generalizes everyone who wants an abortion. As soon as you said “Most people who are aborting are doing so  because they know they won’t be able to raise this baby,” I’m immediately turned off. Someone should have the right to choose an abortion regardless of their reasoning. Putting a “most people” clause also makes this very easy tune out, because the person who hears it will disagree that most people do it because they can’t care for a child and will just say “most people want abortion because they were careless, fucked up, and now don’t want to live with the consequences of their actions.” (Which I should say I also view as a completely valid reason to get an abortion)\n\nI think the best argument comes down property rights. A woman’s body is her property, and if an unwanted person takes up residence on her property without her permission, she should have the right to evict them if she so chooses. The argument about life/death or age of the fetus goes away, and it becomes a property rights discussion. This is summed up by “my body, my choice”  though. And if someone says that’s selfish; does one not have the right to be selfish? Is it illegal to be selfish? We have Wall Street bankers who launched us into the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in stunted careers and increased suicides from lay offs, and it was done out of a form of selfishness; greed. So until they want to outlaw selfishness, I don’t see “that’s selfish” as a good counter to “my body my choice”', 'Yes! This this this!', 'OP is an anti choice dickhead.

Those things however, are not perfect, sometimes condoms break and birth control pills don’t work. Absorption is the last resort safety net. And of course you can’t tell people to just stop having sex, that’s a different argument altogether.', 'Abortion should be legal and accessible regardless. The point of this argument is to convince someone who won’t budge.\n\nAs I said, my body, my choice argument is also correct but you won’t be convincing many conservatives with that one.', 'I think that is a good argument. I think that in tandem with the ""A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty"", which could be construed as a pro-economic (aka anti-welfare) position (assuming that mother, or a good percentage of unexpecting mothers, would then have to go on welfare to take care of additional humans), could win over conservatives. The issue with abortion though, is that bible-belt conservatives don\'t base their anti-abortion arguments on utilitarian or really any ideological positions, but rather on religion, which is not debatable, so I think that is the main issue. But if it came down to a debate, I think any neutral arbiter would see the pro-abortion side as better given these reasons, good job', ""You will never convince someone. Period. It just doesn't happen. People can change on their own, but no matter how much you water down the argument to make it more palatable, it will not change their mind. This is mostly because if they didn't arrive at their conclusion using logic, and instead used faith and religion, then logic won't sway their conclusion either.""]","A better pro-abortion argumentMany people make this single argument when talking about abortion: 'Her body, her choice!'

Someone should have the right to choose an abortion regardless of their reasoning. Putting a “most people” clause also makes this very easy tune out, because the person who hears it will disagree that most people do it because they can’t care for a child and will just say “most people want abortion because they were careless, fucked up, and now don’t want to live with the consequences of their actions.” (Which I should say I also view as a completely valid reason to get an abortion)\n\nI think the best argument comes down property rights. A woman’s body is her property, and if an unwanted person takes up residence on her property without her permission, she should have the right to evict them if she so chooses. The argument about life/death or age of the fetus goes away, and it becomes a property rights discussion. This is summed up by “my body, my choice”  though. And if someone says that’s selfish; does one not have the right to be selfish? Is it illegal to be selfish? We have Wall Street bankers who launched us into the 2008 financial crisis, which resulted in stunted careers and increased suicides from lay offs, and it was done out of a form of selfishness; greed. So until they want to outlaw selfishness, I don’t see “that’s selfish” as a good counter to “my body my choice”', 'Yes! This this this!', 'OP is an anti choice dickhead. The language used in the post gives him away.', 'Of course people are pro abortion.', ""Correct. Besides arguing with the profetus crowd about adoption as an option doesn't cut it.\n\nThe simple idea that the government cannot force me or any woman to give birth (communists did force births).\nCan't chain us to a hospital bed. It's barbaric.\n\nThey only care about the fetus because its easy to do. Caring about children after they are born is another matter entirely."", 'If you are using protection or birth control you are already taking reasonable precautions to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Those things however, are not perfect, sometimes condoms break and birth control pills don’t work. Absorption is the last resort safety net. And of course you can’t tell people to just stop having sex, that’s a different argument altogether.', 'Abortion should be legal and accessible regardless. The point of this argument is to convince someone who won’t budge.\n\nAs I said, my body, my choice argument is also correct but you won’t be convincing many conservatives with that one.', 'I think that is a good argument. I think that in tandem with the ""A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty"", which could be construed as a pro-economic (aka anti-welfare) position (assuming that mother, or a good percentage of unexpecting mothers, would then have to go on welfare to take care of additional humans), could win over conservatives. The issue with abortion though, is that bible-belt conservatives don\'t base their anti-abortion arguments on utilitarian or really any ideological positions, but rather on religion, which is not debatable, so I think that is the main issue. But if it came down to a debate, I think any neutral arbiter would see the pro-abortion side as better given these reasons, good job', ""You will never convince someone. Period. It just doesn't happen. People can change on their own, but no matter how much you water down the argument to make it more palatable, it will not change their mind. This is mostly because if they didn't arrive at their conclusion using logic, and instead used faith and religion, then logic won't sway their conclusion either.""]",reddit.com

(pre Friday Night Massacre)\n\n----\n\nThis travesty is much much more than merely closing branches and slowing mail to disrupt the vote. \n\nHere are a few reasons trump* appointed the acting PG who is a major campaign donor with zero experience (acting because, like many, many other \'acting\' cabinet and department head positions, trump* knows Congress will never approve their appointment)...\n\n* They want to eliminate or disrupt absentee ballots because with more people able to easily vote it means trump* will lose by a landslide.\n\n* They want to reduce efficiency so they can privatize it because of a lack of efficiency, through a no-bid contract to the highest reelection campaign donor \'bidder\'/Mar-A-Lago member - which translates to kickbacks (campaign donations) which equals legal bribes!\n\n* They (trump*) wants to fuck with Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon, the biggest client of USPS, but more important, Bezos owns the \'fake news\' Washington Post who reports the truth about the presidential criminal enterprise for pulling stunts exactly like this one.\n\nAmazon is the biggest client of the USPS.  So big that the Post Office delivers their packages on Sunday - the only mail delivered on Sunday.  Amazon customers who are used to 2 day delivery may now have to wait up to a week or more and may decide to shop elsewhere.  Maybe some Amazon packages \'get lost in the system\' and never delivered...\n\nBecause trump* hates Bezos so much, he is willing to disrupt one of the oldest (1792/George Washington) and most efficient departments of the USA Government just to fuck with Jeff Bezos.

Since January 2020, DeJoy has donated $360,000 to President Trump’s re-election campaign and roughly $70,000 to the Republican National Committee.  He was appointed in May 2020...  \n\n(if you do the math, he donated over $86,000 a month/over $2,866 per day to buy this job that pays $291,650 per year...)\n\nNow you know the price for trump* to sell the job to someone with absolutely no experience.  Let that sink in, and realize that he sold every other high level position under similar circumstances - Mar-A-Lago members bribed trump* to get an \'acting\' position with no experience...\n\nThey spend much, much more to get the job than the job pays.  Think about that...\n\nWhere is the return on investment??\n\nDeJoy and his wife have over $70 million dollars in holdings in USPS competitors UPS and J.B. Hunt Trucking.  Shouldn\'t this be a conflict of interest?  If he makes the Post Office flounder in inefficiency, don\'t you think people will migrate to UPS and his package delivery services??  \n\nOh, his $70 Million dollar package delivery company received $700 million dollars in stimulus funds...\n\nOH WAIT, he is the \'acting\' PG, so he is beyond scrutiny.  It also helps that Barr & the DOJ & the judges and Mitch & the Senate are in trump*s pocket, so, in effect, there are no more checks and balances in American government anymore.\n\nWhat trump* is doing is incredibly heinous!  Yet he eliminated every option of watchdogs...\n\nFunny how that works out, as well as all the oversight committees stripped bare and gagged.\n\nThis new crony sees no problem that all the mail does not get delivered every day (like forever up until now) and it is OK that a backlog is compounded every day, week, month, year...\n\nAlready a daily priority ranking system has been assigned to determine the importance of each envelope or package and how timely it should be delivered, if delivered at all.  Priority Mail is no longer a priority, First Class is an old term for dependable mail...\n\nThe acting Postmaster General and trump* feel it is wasteful to pay overtime, or hire new employees, or keep all post offices open, or budget for infrastructure improvements, or tune up/update the trucks to ensure every day that:\n\n""*[Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds](https://www.federaljobs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bigstock-Mail-Man-During-Snow-Storm-In-58944299.jpg)*""\n\nThe new slogan should be.

(pre Friday Night Massacre)\n\n----\n\nThis travesty is much much more than merely closing branches and slowing mail to disrupt the vote. \n\nHere are a few reasons trump* appointed the acting PG who is a major campaign donor with zero experience (acting because, like many, many other \'acting\' cabinet and department head positions, trump* knows Congress will never approve their appointment)...\n\n* They want to eliminate or disrupt absentee ballots because with more people able to easily vote it means trump* will lose by a landslide.\n\n* They want to reduce efficiency so they can privatize it because of a lack of efficiency, through a no-bid contract to the highest reelection campaign donor \'bidder\'/Mar-A-Lago member - which translates to kickbacks (campaign donations) which equals legal bribes!\n\n* They (trump*) wants to fuck with Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon, the biggest client of USPS, but more important, Bezos owns the \'fake news\' Washington Post who reports the truth about the presidential criminal enterprise for pulling stunts exactly like this one.\n\nAmazon is the biggest client of the USPS.  So big that the Post Office delivers their packages on Sunday - the only mail delivered on Sunday.  Amazon customers who are used to 2 day delivery may now have to wait up to a week or more and may decide to shop elsewhere.  Maybe some Amazon packages \'get lost in the system\' and never delivered...\n\nBecause trump* hates Bezos so much, he is willing to disrupt one of the oldest (1792/George Washington) and most efficient departments of the USA Government just to fuck with Jeff Bezos.  Let that sink in...\n\n* And maybe *the most important reason of all* - \'**TO OWN THE LIBS**\' ! ! ! ! !*\n\n----------\n\nThe new Postmaster General is Louis DeJoy.  Since January 2020, DeJoy has donated $360,000 to President Trump’s re-election campaign and roughly $70,000 to the Republican National Committee.  He was appointed in May 2020...  \n\n(if you do the math, he donated over $86,000 a month/over $2,866 per day to buy this job that pays $291,650 per year...)\n\nNow you know the price for trump* to sell the job to someone with absolutely no experience.  Let that sink in, and realize that he sold every other high level position under similar circumstances - Mar-A-Lago members bribed trump* to get an \'acting\' position with no experience...\n\nThey spend much, much more to get the job than the job pays.  Think about that...\n\nWhere is the return on investment??\n\nDeJoy and his wife have over $70 million dollars in holdings in USPS competitors UPS and J.B. Hunt Trucking.  Shouldn\'t this be a conflict of interest?  If he makes the Post Office flounder in inefficiency, don\'t you think people will migrate to UPS and his package delivery services??  \n\nOh, his $70 Million dollar package delivery company received $700 million dollars in stimulus funds...\n\nOH WAIT, he is the \'acting\' PG, so he is beyond scrutiny.  It also helps that Barr & the DOJ & the judges and Mitch & the Senate are in trump*s pocket, so, in effect, there are no more checks and balances in American government anymore.\n\nWhat trump* is doing is incredibly heinous!  Yet he eliminated every option of watchdogs...\n\nFunny how that works out, as well as all the oversight committees stripped bare and gagged.\n\nThis new crony sees no problem that all the mail does not get delivered every day (like forever up until now) and it is OK that a backlog is compounded every day, week, month, year...\n\nAlready a daily priority ranking system has been assigned to determine the importance of each envelope or package and how timely it should be delivered, if delivered at all.  Priority Mail is no longer a priority, First Class is an old term for dependable mail...\n\nThe acting Postmaster General and trump* feel it is wasteful to pay overtime, or hire new employees, or keep all post offices open, or budget for infrastructure improvements, or tune up/update the trucks to ensure every day that:\n\n""*[Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds](https://www.federaljobs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/bigstock-Mail-Man-During-Snow-Storm-In-58944299.jpg)*""\n\nThe new slogan should be.

"City Adopts Electric Car Charging Ordinance, One Year Later: 300 Charging Stations Approved",17,i9ctc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/i9ctc6/city_adopts_electric_car_charging_ordinance_one/,0,1597397594.0,"The City of San Luis Obispo, California adopted a mandatory EV charging ordinance last year. It goes above and beyond building code and requires not just infrastructure for future install but actual chargers. 

In one year since adoption, nearly 300 plugs have been approved. Projects have not been built yet since the development and construction process takes a while but the effect is there.

Installing during construction is significantly cheaper than retrofit. Most often it is hardly noticeable when building since the cost increase is marginal to the total development cost. Retrofit requires much more labor and therefore costs more. 

This kind of forward thinking is the only way we will get clean transportation and energy!
