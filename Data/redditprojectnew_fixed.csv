I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

It’s hard to gauge based on what tv I’ve seen on cnn MSNBC and various media outlets including TYT, Nomiki Show (she’s wonderful watch her). All these entities interview Q super fans but I’m incredibly interested in knowing how many people actually believe it.

Discussion: my fear about progressives winning,1,jaqx5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/jaqx5j/discussion_my_fear_about_progressives_winning/,7,1602667145.0,"I hope this is the appropriate place but I've had a thought I haven't yet found a place I feel comfortable expressing.  The thought is, such that Progressives do win, I feel like we have to watch them even more than the ""other side"".  Its not that I don't trust Progressives--I am just aware that corruption is not instrinsic to only one side or another, and if a Progressive breaches public trust, that (seems to) reflect badly on me, a person who has Progressive values.  

Further, even with the best intentions, good people can mess up, which is another topic, but I guess I feel like, ""please, please Please!!  If we're able to put you into the office, please don't abuse the power and please don't give into corruption.""  I've studied global history enough to see a minority get into power but totally do almost the same things they were supposed to fight against.  No Progressives I know of has done that, but my opinion is we should first try to change their mind, and if they don't want to, we drop them as quickly as possible.  

As far as messing up, to err is to be human, so I think it'll happen but I just worry that detractors won't let ""us"" get away with very many honest mistakes.  And lets me honest here, it seems to me that the only group that actually wants good things for \*all\* people, and not just a select group, are the Progressives, and they are the only group with any real vision for a future.  A real, inclusionary, \*sustainable\* future.  So, what do you guys think?",Progressive,0

It goes above and beyond building code and requires not just infrastructure for future install but actual chargers. 

In one year since adoption, nearly 300 plugs have been approved. Projects have not been built yet since the development and construction process takes a while but the effect is there.

Installing during construction is significantly cheaper than retrofit. Most often it is hardly noticeable when building since the cost increase is marginal to the total development cost. Retrofit requires much more labor and therefore costs more. 

This kind of forward thinking is the only way we will get clean transportation and energy!

"Why has the dialogue on police reform polarized itself into the opposed stances of ""Law enforcement officers are absolute. All the protestors are rioters and deserve to be shot."" and ""Law enforcement should be abolished. All law enforcement officers are bastards and deserve to be shot.""?",1,huwp1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/huwp1f/why_has_the_dialogue_on_police_reform_polarized/,2,1595317729.0,"This is more of a venting of frustrations than anything else. I felt like at the beginning of these protests, the majority of people were willing to have a reasonable dialogue about police reform, where-in it was generally agreed that the scope of police powers and the militarization of law enforcement should be decreased, and that alternative social assistance programs should be brought up in place of where law enforcement have been acting in cases where the monopoly on violence of the state is necessary. I could and can and did and do agree with that sentiment. Reform the police. Reduce law enforcement funding. Reduce law enforcement militarization. Great. Do it. Wonderful.

So why has this dialogue been polarized so much? It's a rhetorical question, of course, since I know the reason that it's been polarized is because of months of conflict, stress, and violence continuing to push people to further and further extremes, but it's still so *frustrating*. Why are we all engaging in mass campaigns of dehumanization against those standing across from us? Why are we actively calling for the blood of our ""enemies"" to be spilt? Why do we think that our only options are no reform or abolition, reaction or revolution?

Again, I'm just frustrated, and needed to get this off my chest in a community that (I hope) understands my general positions. It gets to the point where I actively begin to doubt myself because I don't see anybody holding the same positions we started with two months ago. Am I in the wrong? Maybe. I don't know. But I wish that the people telling me that I'm wrong could do so without rabid spittle flying from their mouths as they do so, declaring me an enemy of the people if I refuse to side with them on the matter.",Progressive,0

* Current
 * Stephanie E. Jones-Rogers (African American)
 * Waldo E. Martin (African American)
 * Tabitha Kanogo (East African)
 * Andrew E. Barshay (no photo)
 * Michael Nylan (no photo)
* Affiliated (from Berkeley, both of whom are from Slavic Languages & Cultures)
 * David Frick (no photo)
 * Irina Paperno (no photo)

More importantly, the letter misuses the term ""univariate"" and focuses on hyperbolic, emotionally charged language (like calling George Floyd ""the absolute worst specimen of [his] race and species""), and it contains no citations for its assertions, one of which is unsupported and another of which is plainly false (links below to corrections):

* The woman Floyd pointed his gun at was [not described as pregnant](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/06/12/george-floyd-criminal-record/).
* Donations to Black Lives Matter through ActBlue [do not filter to the Biden campaign or any other Democratic Party entities](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/).

Also, among several sentences supporting the Differential Involvement Hypothesis, this one stands out: ""Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict."" Just by searching for that term (which I'll admit, I only knew about because of [a recent FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-police-see-issues-of-race-and-policing/)), I found a few studies that seem to say that although it's not completely wrong, the Differential Involvement Hypothesis does not come close to explaining differential treatment by police on the basis of race:

* ""[Racial Disparities in Arrests: A Race Specific Model Explaining Arrest Rates Across Black and White Young Adults](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-019-00618-7)"" (2019-05-03)
 * ""After controlling for contextual and behavioral factors, we still found Black young adults were arrested seven times more often than their White counterparts.""
* ""[A Test of the Differential Involvement Hypothesis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2153368717697104)"" (2017-03-20)
 * ""The results generated from the unconditional hierarchical model showed that the average self-reports of trouble with the police did not significantly vary across the neighborhoods.  The negative binomial results indicate that African Americans report significantly more trouble with the police while controlling for the respondents’ levels of offending, level of impulsivity, levels of anxiety and depression, gang membership, their family’s criminal involvement, whether they or their parents had serious mental health issues, the respondents’ current and expected economic conditions, their racial affinity, as well as other individual characteristics.""
* ""[Understanding Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Arrest: The Role of Individual, Home, School, and Community Characteristics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12552-016-9183-8)"" (2016-11-03)
 * ""Results showed significantly higher likelihood of having ever been arrested among blacks, when compared to whites, even after controlling for a range of delinquent behaviors&hellip;.""
* ""[Racial differences in speeding patterns: Exploring the differential offending hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235212000554)"" (2012-06-16)
 * ""Analytic models indicated that Black drivers speed more frequently and engage in more severe speeding compared to White drivers, net of controls. &hellip; The findings suggest that citizen risk for specific police behavior is partially attributable to differential behavior prior to the encounter.""

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

The creation of financial instruments to fund the exploitation of non-renewable resources is tantamount to comiting economic suicide. The analogy is an alcoholic saying that he feels good and that nothing bad will happen to him.  Some conomists give humanity 10 years to migrate to a sustainable economy, after which econmic hardship will exponentially expand for humanity.  See [https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/](https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/).  

&#x200B;

The United States, which should be a leader in helping to bring about about an more sustainable economic system based on renewable sources of energy and renewable resources has instead ""walked the paper backward"" over the last 4 years.  Regime change is in the wind. Curren polls indicate a hopeful oucome.  See [https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls), but let us take nothing for granted.

The thought is, such that Progressives do win, I feel like we have to watch them even more than the ""other side"".  Its not that I don't trust Progressives--I am just aware that corruption is not instrinsic to only one side or another, and if a Progressive breaches public trust, that (seems to) reflect badly on me, a person who has Progressive values.  

Further, even with the best intentions, good people can mess up, which is another topic, but I guess I feel like, ""please, please Please!!  If we're able to put you into the office, please don't abuse the power and please don't give into corruption.""  I've studied global history enough to see a minority get into power but totally do almost the same things they were supposed to fight against.  No Progressives I know of has done that, but my opinion is we should first try to change their mind, and if they don't want to, we drop them as quickly as possible.  

As far as messing up, to err is to be human, so I think it'll happen but I just worry that detractors won't let ""us"" get away with very many honest mistakes.  And lets me honest here, it seems to me that the only group that actually wants good things for \*all\* people, and not just a select group, are the Progressives, and they are the only group with any real vision for a future.

Incredibly, there are another thirty-one staffers in her office with total comp exceeding $200,000 annually.

>Police and Sheriff departments– The combined 4,418 employees of the city’s law enforcement agencies cost taxpayers $831 million in compensation last year for an average cost of over $188,000 per person. The police are called “peace officers.”

>Because San Francisco is both a city and a county, it has both a sheriff and police department. Sheriff deputies run the jails, enforce civil judgements, and provide security for court cases, while the police patrol the city.

>Police Chief William Scott earned $434,613 ($338,482 salary and $96,131 benefits). Four assistant chiefs (police and management) received between $346,528 and $445,539. Then, there were 195 employees with pay and perks exceeding $300,000 each.

Maybe should post somewhere else, but don't know where. Thought this came out to be an interesting way to present talking/discussion points. 

This comment was in response to someone asking how important letters of recommendation are, and how a even critical letter might be 'ok' or even in some cases good for the applicant...

&nbsp;


""Sometimes a critical letter might be a an issue/factor that isn't important to me. Also, not all professors (or bosses) are 'good', or a good match for the student/applicant, so you have to be quite careful what you read, and who is the letter-writer.

If there are some critical things, but they are thoughtful comments and look manageable, then I think it's good because that means the letter-writer is engaged with the student/applicant, which is positive overall. I look at student/applicant performance then to see if the criticism and performance 'match', e.g. written work/pubs, grades, etc., and likely I'd bring it up in the interview and see what she/he has to say.

I'd very rarely write someone off though for a critical letter.

&nbsp;


Having said that, however, I have had some really critical letters, like:

&nbsp;


""The applicant appears to have no background, his/her credentials are suspect or completely made up, and lies about everything. The applicant falsifies their work and blames other people when they are discovered and for every ensuing problem (especially problems they made themselves) and actively tries to destroy clearly honorable people if they argue or try and defend themselves.

The applicant shows no empathy or consideration for others at all, even to the point of mocking and mimicking their physical disabilities and appearances in both public and private meetings. The person calls people childish and sometimes obscene names in public, and uses extremely vulgar language in meetings and interviews.

The person is clearly racist, and encourages other racists in public and private including 'white-power' groups to commit violence against other students. The applicant stated in public and on record that 'I could shoot somebody...in the street, kill them, and nobody would care...because it's me.'

Finally, the applicant actively denies critical scientific findings and truth, even faced with undeniable proof, endangering everyone near to him/her. Because of that many of his/her associates and my other students and colleagues have fallen severely ill or died.""

Ok, yes that's a lot. I can see how important it is to cut costs at a time when the airline has seen such a drastic decrease from an average share price in the $30's in March to about $10.7 in April 2020. I can only imagine that it has been barely making ends meet what with its stock price continuing to plummet, top executives foregoing pay to keep people employed because they've received no assistance from the federal government. 

Except No:

[Average AA Share Price April 1, 2020 and October 1, 2020 ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAL/american-airlines-group/stock-price-history) = $10.69/share and $12.58/share

Does this scenario also hold true if the IRS is involved, or would the IRS just seize and sell all my properties and leave me still owing those mortgages?",Progressive,0

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts.

Important PSA: Do not treat tear gas or pepper sprays with the following items,9,iuhl62,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iuhl62/important_psa_do_not_treat_tear_gas_or_pepper/,0,1600370865.0,"*This is taken from the book Riot Medicine, if you have any scientific data to contradict the information presented. I will add it.*

Note: RCA means Riot Control Agent, which is the technical term for things like tear gas and pepper spray.

* **LAW/Maalox:**   Liquid antacid and water (LAW) is a mixture of 50% liquid antacid and 50% water. In some countries, LAW is simply referred to as Maalox \[the name of a popular brand of liquid antacid.\] LAW is an extremely popular treatment, in part because of its simplicity and the minor cooling sensation patients report when LAW is applied to the skin. Liquid antacid does not belong in the eyes, and although rare, ingredients in antacids may cause an allergic reaction. Research on  pain relief provided by topical application of antacid is mixed. One study showed no significant decrease in pain for patients exposed to OC spray after applying liquid antacid. Another showed statistically significant decrease in pain up to the 60 minute mark, but Riot Control Agent   Contamination concluded “the difference in \[pain levels\] may have questionable clinical significance.” Anecdotal evidence supports the idea that LAW decreases pain for OC spray on the skin, but it is not recommended even if it is marginally more effective.
* **Baby Shampoo:**   Baby shampoo has not been shown to be effective when used in the eyes or on the skin for treating either pepper spray or tear gas.
* **FAST:** Fixative antacid surfactant treatment (FAST) is a pepper spray remedy originally published on It’s Going Down. FAST was de-signed to be a more effective alternative to LAW that combined the active ingredients of antacid, sunflower lecithin, and baby shampoo. While there was some   experimentation done by the creators to determine whether this treatment was effective, it lacked the rigor be make conclusions. More generally, research on the individual active ingredients suggests that they do not  provide a statistically significant decrease in pain.
* **Cow's Milk:** Plain cow’s milk is another common treatment for pepper spray and tear gas. Pouring milk into the eyes has risk of infection, and this is especially true on hot days where the milk will not remain refrigerated before use. The stickiness and stench of milk is another downside of using milk as a decontaminant. Most importantly, cow’s milk used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been show to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Oils:** Mineral oil followed immediately by alcohol (MOFIBA) is an outdated treatment for pepper spray contamination that is no longer used by most medics. The treatment worked by covering small patches of skin with mineral oil to attract pepper spray, then removing it with rubbing   alcohol. This was retired from use because if done incorrectly can cause additional pain over pepper spray alone. Similarly, people have used vegetable oil to wash the affected area, wiping the residue off after, and this should not be done either. Both of these methods are harmful because oil will trap the RCA against the skin.
* **Onions:** Onions have been inaccurately reported as effective against tear gas. This belief seems to be most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa. The reported procedure is to breath over whole or cut onions, and in particular to use onions themselves as part of improvised gas masks to mitigate the effects of inhaling tear gas. RCAs, and in particular tear gas, are lachrymators.  Chopped onion releases a chemical which is also a lachrymator. Onions do not mitigate or prevent   the effects of tear gas.
* **Vinegar:** Vinegar is another commonly suggested ineffective remedy and preventative measure for tear gas inhalation. Activists suggest using it as a decontaminant on affected skin. It has been suggested to soak a bandana in vinegar then breath through it to prevent inhalation of tear gas.  Like tear gas, vinegar is a lachrymator. Vinegar vapor irritates the eyes, and prolonged inhalation will irritate the lungs.
* **Citrus:** Lemon and lime have been suggested to be used like vinegar, both as a decontaminant wash for the skin and with a bandana as a filter for tear gas. There is no evidence either of these have any effect on reducing the irritation associated with tear gas or preventing inhalation.
* **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Hydrogen peroxide is another remedy used by activists and medics to treat tear gas and pepper spray. There is no evidence that this has any effect on either, and further, it will cause additional burning sensations if it gets into the eyes or other mucous membranes. Given   that pepper spray is mainly aimed at the face and tear gas affects the eyes, nose, and mouth, there is high risk of causing additional harm to the patient even if it was an effective treatment.
* **Lidocaine:** Lidocaine in particular when used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been shown to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Miscellaneous:** Some activists have suggested a variety of treatments such as using baking soda paste, topical analgesics, or toothpaste to treat affected areas. These are not recommended as they trap RCAs against the skin and may worsen its effects.

I would strongly suggest you read Riot Medicine's section on RCAs to help  deal with protection and treatment. But I'll provide a summary.

**Protection**

Typically protesters will use goggles and a half-mask respirator or disposable respirator. If these are not available, a hat, glasses, and bandana will still offer a moderate amount of protection. A wet bandana made of a fabric with a tight weave held over the mouth will filter a modest mount of tear gas from the air.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that slow, shallow breaths helps minimize the effects of tear gas on the lungs. Patients have reported feeling the immediate urge to vomit after taking deep breaths in the presence of tear gas and that the feeling persisted until they were able to spend significant time breathing fresh air.

**Treatment**

In general, use water or saline (Manufactured salt water used for medical purposes)

* If you're helping others, introduce yourself first and obtain consent to help, if they are unable to give consent. Do not force treatment onto people. If someone is unconscious you can assume consent, but you have bigger problems to deal with than RCAs.
* Remove yourself/the patient from the area the gas or spray is to an area with fresh air to prevent further damage.
* Do not touch the affected areas.
* Allow tear and mucus production, and allow coughing and sneezing. If you or the patient is asthmatic, use an inhaler.
* Remove and clean contact lenses, possibly dispose of them.
* Decontamination: If it's CR, attempt to brush and dust off as much as possible. Avoid use of water or other liquids to decontaminate the patient unless they are already wet or sweaty, or the RCA is in their eyes (which are  already wet). If not, flush the body part with large amounts of water. For parts of the body other than the eyes, spraying large amounts of water on the affected body part is sufficient.
* Rinse the mouth. Even in the absence of burning or irritating sensations in the mouth, it still helps.

The love hasn’t wavered, but in recent years I have struggled with the respect part, and it’s kind of heartbreaking.

My Dad for example, is an intelligent and compassionate man, but he is also a devout Christian and is unable to separate church from state.  He is well-studied in multiple areas of science, but when presented with proven scientific facts that don’t jive with his religious beliefs, he denies them, saying the studies were flawed, or funded by biased groups or individuals.

He supports Trump and says he is voting to re-elect the president because “He has kept all of his promises,” and “he’s bringing jobs and God back to America.”

My Dad has always shown respect for women and minorities, but he doesn’t mind that Trump is openly opposite in those areas.

Racism has been the underside of America throughout our history. The manner with which we have treated Racism has led to our current moment. How we acknowledge and confront Racism today will have a major impact on our future. This means examining our institutional challenges, class struggles, and more, important, ourselves.

Please join us for this important and informative session, featuring two of the country's leading authorities on systemic racism.

This infuriates me because it often comes from people who make no reasonable efforts to counter child abuse at other times and it's clearly being made in bad faith, ""Won't somebody think of the children!?!"" but has enough logic behind it that I find it difficult to counter intellectually.

I do believe that local, state, and the federal governments should be taking this into consideration and providing resources to help mitigate the issue, but I also don't think it's in any way a justification for sending children back to school or into other potentially dangerous situations which could spread covid.

Feminist economics is both a research paradigm and a praxis: a political commitment to uncover women’s economic realities and to rectify the power structures that cause those realities, thereby increasing human well-being for both women and men.

A better pro-abortion argument,6,icl7r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/icl7r8/a_better_proabortion_argument/,20,1597862184.0,"Many people make this single argument when talking about abortion: 'Her body, her choice!' Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well. This is not fair for the baby similar to how it is not fair for a terminally ill to not have access to [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia). A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort. This argument applies even more to the USA as the cost of childbirth and care is enormous here with very little government support.

Also since this is a safe place to debate abortion, let me bust this common anti-abortion argument: BUt tHeN wHy kIlLing pregnant woMen counts as doUble mUrdEr? It's because we assume the child will not be aborted dummy, most pregnancies end with childbirth. A woman does not tell her intentions to abort to her murderer.",Progressive,0

It goes above and beyond building code and requires not just infrastructure for future install but actual chargers. 

In one year since adoption, nearly 300 plugs have been approved. Projects have not been built yet since the development and construction process takes a while but the effect is there.

Installing during construction is significantly cheaper than retrofit. Most often it is hardly noticeable when building since the cost increase is marginal to the total development cost. Retrofit requires much more labor and therefore costs more.

An essay that seeks to define ""time inequality"", one of the most corrosive forms of inequality that's disappeared from the landscape of American political economy.

Time inequality is an inequality of 'time ownership'. Designing for time ownership (the Ancient Greeks just called it freedom, 19th + 20th century America called it leisure time) offers an abiding ideal for a revitalized political economy.

Designing for time ownership calls for new approaches to capital ownership, implementing new institutions that steward our national wealth for more democratic benefit.

Feel free to comment any criticism! I'm always trying to get better.

* The video is titled “How to End White Privilege,” so I’m sure that’s what he’ll discuss
   * ...oh
* Hello, token black conservative!
* Immediately, he misunderstands the purpose of acknowledging white privilege
   * It’s not to feel good or virtue signal
   * It’s to better inform current and future policy
   * We don’t acknowledge gravity because it makes us feel better, we acknowledge it because
      * A) Doing so helps us understand and explain reality better
      * B) It helps us build better systems
   * We acknowledge white privilege because it helps us understand current racial divisions in the US and allows us to more effectively work towards remedying such issues
* He uses a lackluster definition: ""because you’re born with white skin, you have all these advantages I don’t have.""
   * By viewing a statistical/systemic issue from an anecdotal/individualistic approach, you’ve very effectively strawmanned the argument.
   * Wikipedia actually does a really good job at defining it: “White privilege is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.”
   * Wonder why they left that second piece out??
* Like what?
   * It’s interesting that he doesn’t touch on two of the most important issues facing black people
      * Unfair sentencing
      * Over policing
* “I got the house”
   * [Black owned firms are twice as likely to be rejected for loans according to the federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-september-availability-of-credit-to-small-businesses.htm)
   * [But he talked about houses: the pew research center found that black people were denied mortgages at almost 3 times the rate of white people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/10/blacks-and-hispanics-face-extra-challenges-in-getting-home-loans/)
   * OP, I hear you say, causation does not equal correlation. Maybe all of that comes down to wealth inequality, not race.
      * We know that
      * This means that if loan discrimination happened at some point in the (fairly recent) past, we would still be feeling the effect of it and it could largely account for this current disparity
* Which brings us to Redlining :(
   * “I’ve never heard of such a banker”
      * [Well, on the loan side, you have redlining, it all started when the Federal Housing Administration refused to insure mortgages in/near black neighborhoods. ](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * [From there banks ran with it: they would not provide loans to anybody in these neighborhoods (even though “redlined” areas weren’t all more likely to default on loans)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5FBJyqfoLM)
      * [Then, many neighborhoods would disallow many black people from buying a house because it would devalue the surrounding properties (even neighborhoods that the FHA subsidized)](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * This happened until the mid to late sixties?!?!?!?
* Suspicion in a store
   * Studies show that black people are believed to be more suspicious with the same amount of evidence
      * [mock jurors were given the same evidence for a case but the surveillance footage showed either a dark skinned or a light skinned person. ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601615)
      * [In another study, entry level criminal justice students found photos of light skinned inmates more trustworthy than dark skinned inmates.](https://ir.ua.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/3276/file_1.pdf)
* “What if I had a **store** that had a history of **being shoplifted** by **young black women**, and a **young black woman** with a bad attitude **walked in**? Would I **be suspicious**? Yea I would… I call that common sense.”
   * Just wanted to point out that this argument can be used to justify racial profiling, which would perpetuate racial crime disparities
      * Here’s how:
* “Blacks have more privilege than whites”
   * I’m interested to see where this goes. Maybe he’ll talk about college or something?
      * “It’s been my experience”
      * [Oh… so no real argument.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal)
   * Notice how PragerU sometimes doesn’t use real data for their figures/visuals/graphs
      * It’s almost like they dont’t have any data to support some of the claims they make
* “If two people are equally qualified for a job, the black person will usually get it.”
   * No data again? No problem, I have some.
      * [The National Bureau of Economic Research found that the same application with a white sounding name gets 50% more callbacks than with an african-american sounding name.](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html)
      * [Another study found that](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000312240907400505) 
* “If you deny this, you’re denying reality” says the man with zero sources lol
* For the mcintosh/bandage example, I like how they pick the weakest one
   * [Here is the actual, full paper](https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mcintosh.pdf)
   * Also, he acts like normalizing white skin color as skin color doesn’t demean black people by treating white skin as default and accepted.
* “Today, these so called progressives dominate our colleges and universities.”
   * I wonder why progressivism dominates educated circles lol
* He just spends the next couple minutes misunderstanding the point of white privilege again.
* “How could this not create a victim mentality?”
   * I dunno, maybe if we fixed it instead of letting it fester
   * Also, are you saying we shouldn’t tell uncomfortable, studied truths?
      * Isn’t Conservatism all about uncomfortable truths? They don't call it the intellectual socially acceptable web.
* How come he accepts the existence of two-parent family privilege, American privilege, and good gene privilege yet fails to accept white privilege due to a counterpoint that applies equally to all of the above privileges?
   * He argues: Doesn’t **white privilege** depend on the person? If a **black lawyer and his wife** have a baby and a **meth addict, single white woman** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **white** one? Because he’s **white**? Cmon now!
   * Using his logic, you could say: Doesn’t **two-parent family privilege** depend on the person? If a **single lawyer mother** has a baby and a **meth addict, abusive couple** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with two parents**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **American privilege** depend on the person? If a **lawyer English couple** has a baby and a **meth addict, single American** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **American**? Because he’s **American**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **good gene privilege** depend on the person? If a **doctor couple who understand how to control heart issues but have genes with a higher risk of heart disease** have a baby and a **meth addict, single mother** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with better genes**? Because he’s **less likely to have heart issues**? Cmon now!
   * This is because all four examples are equally a privilege, but he tries to completely change the implication of privilege for white privilege:
      * Having a single privilege does not guarantee an easy life (there are way too many other factors), but it does mean that that one aspect of your life isn’t going to be what makes it harder for you than others.
* In the end, this video boils down to a few issues: a lack of understanding of why we identify white privilege, a lack of evidence for or against arguments, and a misunderstanding of what privilege even does.

"Why has the dialogue on police reform polarized itself into the opposed stances of ""Law enforcement officers are absolute. All the protestors are rioters and deserve to be shot."" and ""Law enforcement should be abolished. All law enforcement officers are bastards and deserve to be shot.""?",3,huwp1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/huwp1f/why_has_the_dialogue_on_police_reform_polarized/,2,1595317729.0,"This is more of a venting of frustrations than anything else. I felt like at the beginning of these protests, the majority of people were willing to have a reasonable dialogue about police reform, where-in it was generally agreed that the scope of police powers and the militarization of law enforcement should be decreased, and that alternative social assistance programs should be brought up in place of where law enforcement have been acting in cases where the monopoly on violence of the state is necessary. I could and can and did and do agree with that sentiment. Reform the police. Reduce law enforcement funding. Reduce law enforcement militarization. Great. Do it. Wonderful.

So why has this dialogue been polarized so much? It's a rhetorical question, of course, since I know the reason that it's been polarized is because of months of conflict, stress, and violence continuing to push people to further and further extremes, but it's still so *frustrating*. Why are we all engaging in mass campaigns of dehumanization against those standing across from us? Why are we actively calling for the blood of our ""enemies"" to be spilt? Why do we think that our only options are no reform or abolition, reaction or revolution?

Again, I'm just frustrated, and needed to get this off my chest in a community that (I hope) understands my general positions.

A View to Change Life,3,hkt57k,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/hkt57k/a_view_to_change_life/,0,1593847215.0,"With all that is happening in my country (or around the world, I just happen to be from the US)—including the BLM movement, COVID-19, the upcoming election—there is an idea I embrace that shapes how I view the world and its people.  Divisive events magnify this idea for me.  It is the idea that has led me to a Master’s in human services and counseling, working with the dying in hospice, work in a psychiatric crisis unit, a detox unit, and doing legal work for indigents.  It is the idea that leads me to view nobody as a stranger.  It is an idea I want to share because I believe that with practice it can improve everybody’s existence.

In life, humans must constantly make decisions, choosing between options.  *There are an infinite number of variables that change the way these options **appear** to each person*.  These variables affect everyone’s perception of their options.  Even with the exact same options, they will not appear the same to different people.  This is vital to keep in mind.  People try to make the best choices to fulfill their needs, with the information they have in that moment, *and through the lens of their brain—a lens, you will see, they do not choose*.

Here is an example: “He didn’t have to dropout and sell drugs.  He had the option to go to school and work hard just like everybody else!  That’s what I did!”  To simplify, let’s say Option A is to stay in school and Option B is to dropout and sell drugs.  To somebody whose brain made certain connections and pathways based on genetics/biological factors/their environment/and so on, Option B may present itself as a more feasible/realistic/helpful/plausible/or appealing choice than Option A.  This person has both options like others but based on a connections in their brain Option B is the choice their mind pulls towards.  *Options’ appeal do not present equally to humans*.  I believe this goes infinitely deeper.  Let’s say that somebody argues, “That may be true, but part of why so-and-so chose Option B is because they damaged their brain when they chose to use drugs” (there are a million similar arguments).  Again, I believe that you could break that decision up into Options A and B.  The same with working to improve your mind, by, say, learning through reading or counseling or exercise or any number of items.  The decision and drive to read for knowledge—Option A, vs. the decision not to do so—Option B.  You can see how these options and decisions create a snowball effect that continues to shape the connections and pathways in the mind.  A brain must decide if it wants to change itself.  *Not through the lens of somebody else’s mind, but through its own lens*.  I understand this is simplified, but I strongly believe that keeping this in mind when viewing other people is incredibly powerful.  Not just for humanity, but for your own sanity and evolution.  *Keep in mind that your brain is no different*.  It will keep you humble, open-minded, and more accepting.

This idea continues to be reinforced in my mind.  An example is that my sister writes mitigation reports for those charged with murder(s) and facing the death penalty.  Time and time again, she completes mitigation reports for these defendants.  And time and time again, similar backgrounds appear.  *This is no coincidence.  These connections made (or never made) in the brain are determined by events caused by the connections that were currently in the brain at that time, that were made because of previous events that occurred because of the connections in the brain at that time, and so on.*

If the above is true, then it is extra disheartening and discouraging to see so many people dehumanized around the world. Divisive events amplify this.  Take the BLM movement for example.  Many are dehumanizing the black community.  Many are dehumanizing the police, dehumanizing protestors, dehumanizing business owners, dehumanizing anybody who does not strictly agree with their side.  Sometimes done consciously, but many times unconsciously.  (Arguments can be made about how to prioritize which dehumanization needs addressing urgently—I would say likely the dehumanization that is ending with peoples’ death, but this does not change the idea that guides me).  A human, flawed as we all are, is behind every viewpoint or opinion, and the lens of their brain tells them they have good reason to feel this way, to meet their basic needs.  

It is easy for my mind to react with anger and want the harshest punishment for an (ex) officer like Chauvin.  After time to process, I can look through the lens of what I’ve laid out above.  I use Chauvin as an example because I feel like he is one that many (most?) people feel the strongest negative emotions about as a human right now.  *I keep in mind that a mitigation report could be written about any human*, including Chauvin.  While what he did was obviously atrociously wrong (it seems that close to everybody at least agrees on this), *there were connections and pathways that were formed that made him feel like he was making the right decision with the information he had at that time*.  Some might say, “Yeah!  That asshole wanted to feel powerful!  And he was racist!”  I ask, why were those the options he felt were correct at that time?  If he is racist, what led to those connections in his brain?  What basic needs are those fulfilling for him?  He is human.  I think this viewpoint allows me to feel physically sick about what happened to George Floyd, and at the same time to feel sad for Chauvin.  He is a human.  He may be scared or confused right now.  He may even feel justified and angry and like he did nothing wrong (but keep in mind why).  *I choose Chavin as my example because I believe if this can be applied to the most extreme, then it can be applied to anybody on this Earth.*  

During my time spent working on a psychiatric crisis unit, I recall hearing staff say about many patients, “This guy/girl is a real asshole.”  One example was a man that was loudly racist/sexist/violent.  I remember a medical professional laughing with another staff member that this “asshole” patient had to wear a diaper.  I discovered in speaking with him that he wore a diaper because of permanent injury he suffered from a beating his father gave him when he was a child.  Can you imagine the connections made or not made in this patient’s mind?  Can you imagine how these connections (or lack of) shaped how his mind evolved—which shaped how his viewpoints and behavior evolved and how his options look through his brain’s lens?  The defensive and safety mechanisms that formed?  *Everybody’s mind does this.*

Everybody is human.  *Everybody’s brain/mind is shaped by events that were out of their control and continued to be shaped by options they chose based on those connections, which reinforces more connections and pathways*.  A Nazi was once a baby, whose mind began construction in the womb.  I can love the human in a Nazi while feeling furious with their views, *and that which led to their views*.  I do not have to accept their views to accept their humanity and treat them accordingly.  Humans can change, but it takes time and compassion, an open-mind and acceptance, and **empathy**.  It takes showing alternative ways of meeting needs.  It takes working through lots of fear.  Views will always be easier or harder for a human to change based on their lens.  Ultimately, the most powerful and effective form of change does not come from guilt or threat or shame, but rather a change from compassion and understanding, where the individual wants to change.  I think this is important to keep in mind with any divisive topic.  It’s why I rarely think violence is the answer (think no other choice but self-defense).  It’s why I never think dehumanizing is the answer.  Urgent change can be made in any issue without dehumanizing and by addressing what needs are being fulfilled and the fear behind it, and the change will be far more effective.

Find the human in each and every person.  The police officer.  The black person.  The white person.  The terrorist.  Trump.  The protester.  Biden.  The business owner.  It’s there, and it will strip away the extremely negative emotions tied to them that hold us back from real progress.",Progressive,0

"I propose a new tool to increase our power to create change by publicly pledging to join a mass action unless demands are met. Petitions are a scam, mostly ignored they exist so we can feel 'at least i did something' rather than doing something. 1-click participation but with teeth.",1,hc07z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/hc07z0/i_propose_a_new_tool_to_increase_our_power_to/,1,1592600227.0,"I'm looking for a home for an idea to create a new tool to empower people through mass political actions, unfortunately it gets deleted every time i post to \[the UK subreddits\]([https://old.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/hbh1fo/government\_petitions\_are\_a\_scam\_mostly/](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/hbh1fo/government_petitions_are_a_scam_mostly/) ) despite receiving many comments and up votes before the hammer comes down. Despite the examples being UK based, can it stay here? The inspiration was from the UK but the tool would be global.   


I started writing this as a Reddit post out of frustration when the Cummings petition, which was a total waste of energy from the beginning, hit the top of the UK subs.

&#x200B;

Half way through writing it I realised that the best case scenario was a few thousand angry up-votes and agreeing comments, and then ..nothing. Exactly like the thing i was posting to complain about. 

&#x200B;

So instead i turned the post into \[a quick Kickstarter project\]([https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/focallocal/powered-up-petitions?ref=project\_build](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/focallocal/powered-up-petitions?ref=project_build) )

&#x200B;

The basic premise is that petitions are far too easy to ignore, and especially by Governments most are. 

&#x200B;

They are great at engaging people. 1 click and a nice feeling that you've done something, but what is that something?

&#x200B;

If that one click was:

&#x200B;

\- a public pledge easily shared for all your friends to see 

\- to join in a (non-violent) mass action on a set date 

\- to occur if the pledge reaches a pre-agreed number of signatures

\- if specific set of demands aren't met before that date

&#x200B;

Then your one-click would be just as easy to join in with, but have some teeth if ignored.  It would also encourage creative ideas for how to apply pressure as i consider protesting a fairly blunt tool also, given that the biggest protests in history were against the Iraq war, and... 

&#x200B;

The Kickstarter is pretty basic as its simply a converted Reddit post. If it gets some attention i'll add videos and wireframes, etc to make it more presentable and engaging. Also feel welcome to reach out if you'd like to join the team and help building it. Suggestions are welcome.

&#x200B;

Honestly, i'm just exhausted of feeling like we are so powerless to the whims of a tiny group of elites and wanted to see a tool that would apply pressure more effectively.",Progressive,0

If we are to move forward as a modern society this must be aggressively addressed and rooted out. But justice doesn't stop with the police brutality that has dominated the news cycle as of late. We must also reform our inherently racist economic system.

More importantly, the letter misuses the term ""univariate"" and focuses on hyperbolic, emotionally charged language (like calling George Floyd ""the absolute worst specimen of [his] race and species""), and it contains no citations for its assertions, one of which is unsupported and another of which is plainly false (links below to corrections):

* The woman Floyd pointed his gun at was [not described as pregnant](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/06/12/george-floyd-criminal-record/).
* Donations to Black Lives Matter through ActBlue [do not filter to the Biden campaign or any other Democratic Party entities](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/).

Also, among several sentences supporting the Differential Involvement Hypothesis, this one stands out: ""Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict."" Just by searching for that term (which I'll admit, I only knew about because of [a recent FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-police-see-issues-of-race-and-policing/)), I found a few studies that seem to say that although it's not completely wrong, the Differential Involvement Hypothesis does not come close to explaining differential treatment by police on the basis of race:

* ""[Racial Disparities in Arrests: A Race Specific Model Explaining Arrest Rates Across Black and White Young Adults](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-019-00618-7)"" (2019-05-03)
 * ""After controlling for contextual and behavioral factors, we still found Black young adults were arrested seven times more often than their White counterparts.""
* ""[A Test of the Differential Involvement Hypothesis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2153368717697104)"" (2017-03-20)
 * ""The results generated from the unconditional hierarchical model showed that the average self-reports of trouble with the police did not significantly vary across the neighborhoods.  The negative binomial results indicate that African Americans report significantly more trouble with the police while controlling for the respondents’ levels of offending, level of impulsivity, levels of anxiety and depression, gang membership, their family’s criminal involvement, whether they or their parents had serious mental health issues, the respondents’ current and expected economic conditions, their racial affinity, as well as other individual characteristics.""
* ""[Understanding Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Arrest: The Role of Individual, Home, School, and Community Characteristics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12552-016-9183-8)"" (2016-11-03)
 * ""Results showed significantly higher likelihood of having ever been arrested among blacks, when compared to whites, even after controlling for a range of delinquent behaviors&hellip;.""
* ""[Racial differences in speeding patterns: Exploring the differential offending hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235212000554)"" (2012-06-16)
 * ""Analytic models indicated that Black drivers speed more frequently and engage in more severe speeding compared to White drivers, net of controls. &hellip; The findings suggest that citizen risk for specific police behavior is partially attributable to differential behavior prior to the encounter.""

The again, the US have been shaping the entire world for such a long time, I feel us foreigners have earnt the right to criticize you when it's necessary. Especially as I'm someone who loves the country (well, I consider it to be the land of the best and the land of the worst, as I've told her) and has been closely following the situation (albeit from afar, but internet is a magical place) over the Atlantic for well over a decade.

Anyways, after she told me : ""*Now if you wish to discuss in an adult manner and not disparage my country or my President, I’ll listen and correct then misinformation you’ve been fed by liberal a\*\*clowns! If not... have a good day""*

I replied with : *""As I've said, I love your country, it's the land of the best and the land of the worst for me. I wont diss on the country, truly. Your president on the other hand is one of the worst scumbags our species has to offer. And he shouldnt be above criticism.""*

To which she said : ""*Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.""*

Which at first took me completely by surprise... so there are people out there who genuinely believe there is nothing one can reproach to Trump or criticize him on, that's... I mean... waw.

So, well, that was over half an hour ago and I've spent the last twenty minutes replying to her with all that came to my mind... and there is so much it was hell to begin with. It was interesting to me that the first thing that came to my mind what his telling to the 4 American Congresswomen (three of them were born in the US) to go back to their own country...

And then, after I typed those words, everything else flooded and I had to stop myself at some point. But yeah, that made me realize once more the strategy of that scumbag of a human being : drown every scandal with a bigger one so we dont know where to start with him.

Now... over six hours later, she replied. For my mental health, I dont want to discuss with such a person any further, but I felt like sharing some of the bits she answered me with... and truth be told, I wouldnt even know where to start replying to a person so far up their ass, I dont think it's even worth it... but still, there you go (keep in mind, all my posts were posted in succession six hours ago and she only replied to some now) : 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her : *Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.*

Me : *Just one ? I could go for ages, but at the top of my head: telling four American women (three of them who were born in the US mind you !) to go back to their country.  One more? Saying there are respectable people on both sides when nazis are concerned...* 

Her : *The respectable remark was a lie!  That is NOT what he said.  See, you get all the liberal spin, and the desire to believe everything you hear without research, (sheep).  You’re simply wrong* 

Me : *This could go on for ages... let's talk insulting a crippled reporter at a rally. Or forcing Ivanka's presence at a G7 summit where she had no place at all. Or Judge Curiel's affair... or asking for Obama's birth certificate... or just contradicting himself everytime he talks.* 

Her : *We have a law that you must be a natural born citizen to be POTUS, let me inform you that it was Hillary who brought up he wasn’t born here when she was running against him!* 

Me : *Or the hypocrisy at calling Obama on his golfing practice when he has spent a gazillion more times than him golfing. Again, the list could go for hours. I have a huge respect for America, but that man is an utter disgrace to the humankind. On every aspect.* 

Her :  *I could careless about golfing, except when an American had his head removed from his shoulders and Obama cried for the camera, turned and hit the fairway!* 

Me :  *Or using his position to blackmail assistance to a country in exchange for personal political gain. Or pardoning a war-criminal (Eddie Gallagher). Or the Stormy Daniels incident (I thought conservatives put more values than that on being a family man).* 

Her :  *Stormy Daniels said a few months ago, she lied... it never happened!*   
*You mean Ukraine, but I’m sorry... that’s been debunked.  Only radical lefties used that for impeachment purposes.  Not one word had been mentioned about Ukraine since!* 

Me :  *Oh yeah, I havent even mentioned the ""grab them by the pussy"" part. Or calling Covid a hoax when he had intel reports over two months previously. Or his blatant racism towards tenants back in 1973:*  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) 

Her :  *The hot mic moment? who cares? There’s not one man of power, and means who hasn’t taken advantage of that fact to get the most beautiful woman whom btw, have been giving it away to the highest bidder for ages!*  
*In 1973? Well damn... did you know the grand wizard of the KKK was friends with Biden and Hillary Clinton’s mentor? Give me a break.  We was barely out of segregation at that time.  Things, times and minds have evolved since then!*   
*The “hoax” mentioned, would you have heard the entire speech was that the democrats bi\*ching about Trump not taking steps early enough was a hoax! He did a China ban while Pelosi was telling people to “come to Chinatown”!* 

***Note : the following exchange was one of the very first one we had, but putting it here cause I think it's less relevant to  the overall conversation.*** 

Me : *As I've said, there's so many things to love about the US, but not only. For me, it's the land of the absolute best and the absolute worst our species has to offer. :)* 

Her : *That could be said about anywhere on the planet you picked. The difference between here and so many other places is we get to choose if we want to be an a\*\* or not! Gotta love freedom* 

Me : *But freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Freedom is not absolute. And before you jump on me, I'm French, I've quite verse with what freedom entails. Freedom of speech doesnt protect you from freedom of consequences of your speech for exemple.* 

Her :  *I agree, and with great freedom comes great responsibility and our press has forgot about that and all they want to do is malign, disparage and lie every chance they get and then print a retraction on pg 20 in small print, when they’re caught in the BS.* 

\-----------------------------------------------

So there you go... I'm not gonna waste anymore time debating with someone like that. It's exhausting and I've sadly come to questionning why I've wasted so much energy on a country that is not mine (even though I love it and would really wish to come and become a US citizen at some point, but damn, that is such a hard and discouraging thing to accomplish), but I felt like this convo needed to be shared so as much people as possible can have an insight (even if it's just one person) into how Trump boot-lickers think and see the world.

Have a great day, night or whatever, and keep up the good fight America, you got this and I'm sure you'll get out of it better and stronger.

Colorado Civil Background Check Rules are being changed! Colorado Supreme Court is asking for input!,4,g7i4ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g7i4ar/colorado_civil_background_check_rules_are_being/,1,1587796248.0," 

Hi Everyone!

County  Court Civil Rules Committee will be meeting again in June.  The March  meeting was cancelled for obvious reasons.  Please remember, one of the  major points of discussion involve suppressing false accusations being  made in Civil Court to bypass criminal rules and procedures.

Basically what's been going on in Colorado is an influx of people like Landlords, Collections Agencies and Family/Neighbors filing revenge claims in Civil Court with Criminal Accusations attached to harass or extort their target.  Colorado Supreme Court has been discussing it since last September (you can find the minutes of their meetings in the link below) and are getting ready to change how Civil Checks work.  This is a big deal and they are asking people for their input.

I do not believe this is a conservative or liberal issue, I believe it is an everybody issue.

I  am asking all of you to write a letter requesting swift action to the  rules change that will allow an accused person to suppress dismissed  allegations.  For those who don't know what's going on in Colorado,  here's a basic summary:

Landlords,  Collections Agencies, Neighbors, Family and Co Workers are using civil  laws designed to protect victims to file false claims of criminal acts  while bypassing the criminal justice system (this includes Protection  Orders and other Red Flag type laws).  They can then drop the  accusations before an evidentiary hearing to prevent the accused from  providing proof of innocence, it also allows the accuser to make a  verbal accusation without evidence of wrongdoing.The Judge then vacates  but without prejudice, allowing the accused to bring the accusation up  again if a new event happens.  This legitimizes the first accusation,  even if no evidence was provided, despite sections of the law that  prohibit an accusation from being used as evidence of  wrongdoing.Collections Agencies are even more suited to abusing the law,  because all they have to do is claim they were threatened when  presenting the accused with a demand.  They can directly then garnish  the wages.  We now have a law against surprise billing, but it still  doesn't help those who have been falsely accused of a violent act in  court by Collections Agencies.

The  Colorado Civil Rules committee can be found here, along with a link to  minutes of their meetings.  I believe they first started discussing the  issues at play in September.  


(Apparently I can't post a link right now I have to post the thread first)  


So what is their solution?  Their solution is to officially add District Court Rules 121 p 1-5 to the County Court System.  This is a decent solution but there are holes to this.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you support this, which is cool, LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU SUPPORT!

I am personally advocating for an AUTOMATED PROCESS.

The benefits of an automated process over a Judicial Discretionary Process are:

1. Less stress on the court system.
2. Significantly  reduced legal fees.  Since minorities and the  impoverished are  directly affected by this, reduced legal fees are a  major point.
3. County  Court Judges have already expressed a desire to err on the  side of  caution far too much, so much so it's created the problem we are  facing  today.
4. More  expedient.  The current Rule 121 p 1-5 system requires a  judge to  weigh the pros and cons, and it can take weeks or months before  an  answer is received.
5. Out  of state people who have been maliciously targeted will need  an  automated system to alleviate the extreme burden of a prolonged  hearing  process.

The automated process would require these things:

1. An independent investigation by a 3rd party proving there is no evidence of wrongdoing
2. The accusation is dropped or dismissed
3. support of the original petitioner to be considered in place of one or both of the above two

If  those conditions are met then the accusation is sealed.  If there  was  no wrong doing, then it is expunged after the statute of limitations   for the original accusation is up.

IN  EITHER CASE, I FULLY support ANY rule change the CRC chooses to make.   If they stick with expanding District Court Rule 121 p 1-5, then we  should still support it because it's better than nothing.  PLEASE  contact them and give your support for an expedient decision!

Written/mailed  letters (not email, letters) are more beneficial than  phone calls.  I  don't even think they accept emails.  Justice Richard  Gabriel is in  charge of the Civil Rules Committee.  Please be  respectful, not  demanding.",Progressive,0

Voter registration and turnout? Really feels like the ban on immigration is Trump activating his base and social construction of the wall. Frustrated for those who are already subjected to a grueling process. Can’t help but notice the Schengen travel restriction as well. Feels unsettling and scary and almost as if extreme restrictions are being made under the guise of a pandemic. Obviously not interested in anything spreading but a ban on immigration feels political not practical when there simply could have been followed quarantine post arrival. Concerned about the inevitable nationalism developing with states. Is this unfounded and anxious or rooted in events that parallel Hitlers rise to power pre WW2... the increase in national debt (totally support the stimulus program for individuals and think government support is pivotal), unemployment insurance (again think this is totally necessary just trying to draw parallels), scapegoating Asian  folks and xenophobia towards Asian communities. I also hate that Trump is the only candidate getting media attention right now especially since incumbent always has advantage. Also wondering if anyone knows why removing EPA regulations benefits oil? Trump cited aid to oil as the reason for this. Doesn’t make sense to me.

"Our medical workers are on the ""Front Line,"" why don't we treat our medical professionals like the soldiers they are?",3,g5qb6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g5qb6l/our_medical_workers_are_on_the_front_line_why/,0,1587540835.0,"OK, so this might be the wrong place for it, but I've been thinking a lot about our broken healthcare system (US) and our response to COVID. I'm hearing various media outlets say that our medical professionals are on the ""front lines"" of the virus outbreak, and i think this is a very apt metaphor; front lines generally used to describe the battlefront in war. I began to extrapolate it further, and started thinking of what it would look like if we trained Doctors like soldiers.

One of the things i think our military does very well is the education for service trade off. I almost took advantage of it myself 12 years ago, but then i met my wife and I didn't want to leave her to join the military. My plan was to get a degree through the military and then serve as repayment, like many of our service members, I felt like this was a better choice than student loans. 

We hear all the time that our medical professionals have incredible student loan debt, and we also hear we don't have enough doctors and nurses... What I've dreamt up is essentially a branch of the military for healthcare. Enlist in the service, get your medical training, and then serve as a doctor for the government for a period of time. These people would be deployed, the same way our soldiers are deployed. Maybe that means in a podunk town in Arkansas (shout out to my family in Japton) or maybe you're in NY or LA... who knows. You'd be put up in government housing during your time serving, something akin to barracks, and would be paid a salary far below what a doctor normally makes, but enough cover basic living expenses, but in exchange you got your medical training debt free. 

Personally, i'm a proponent of a single payer healthcare system, but i also don't feel like that is going to happen in the US without serious push back; if i'm being pragmatic and honest with myself, I think a public option will probably be what actually happens. This military like medical service could support the public option. This would also open up the lucrative field of becoming a medical professional to those who may be economically disadvantaged. The kicker would be that you aren't guaranteed to become a doctor unless you can perform in the school and in rotations. You might leave with a ton of experience and the ability to work in healthcare, but maybe not a medical license to become a PCP or a medical doctor in a hospital; there still needs to be some sort of performance requirement and evaluation to make sure you can cut it in this high stakes position, but this would be a possible path to get there without expensive student loans. This would also incentivize a very cost effective and streamlined federal medical school, and outline federal medical education standard.

The bonus is the added flexibility. Right now, we have locations with shortages of doctors and nurses, and other locations that aren't hit as hard. Since these medical servicemen and women are tasked by the government, they could be redeployed to virus hot spots. Hell, even a war zone if shit really hits the fan.

The other bonus I see is better staffing for the VA with doctors who are serving out their time paying off uncle sam. 

Additionally, this could drive down the expense of doctors in two ways; 1) more doctors would be able to get their medical license cheaper than they are today, and wont be paying off student loans until they're 50, but 2) a massive supply and demand shift as we have a larger supply of doctors and medical professionals in the country. 

Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of problems with this idea, I'd love to hear why you hate it or why you like it. I'm also probably the least qualified person because i'm not a doctor. I'm remotely tied with the healthcare industry, but as a webdeveloper; i've never gone to medical school. So I'm not married to it, i wont be offended if you call me a fucking moron, but i'm also just looking for opinions on this. I doubt i'm the only one who has thought of this; maybe you know of some politicians advocating something like this? I dunno. Just tell me what you think.",Progressive,0

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Planet Earth has a finite ecological base with finite exploitable resources.  Our world economic systen requires open-ended economic growth to maintain it's existance. The creation of financial instruments to fund the exploitation of non-renewable resources is tantamount to comiting economic suicide. The analogy is an alcoholic saying that he feels good and that nothing bad will happen to him.  Some conomists give humanity 10 years to migrate to a sustainable economy, after which econmic hardship will exponentially expand for humanity.  See [https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/](https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/).  

&#x200B;

The United States, which should be a leader in helping to bring about about an more sustainable economic system based on renewable sources of energy and renewable resources has instead ""walked the paper backward"" over the last 4 years.  Regime change is in the wind. Curren polls indicate a hopeful oucome.  See [https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls), but let us take nothing for granted.

&#x200B;

There is a window of opportunity remaining, and you can still make a difference.  Encourage soft supporters of the current regime to sit up and take notice of the satirical visuals and narrative at [commandercovid.com](https://commandercovid.com).  Satire, properly marketed, can be an effective force for positive social change.  Keep the Faith!",Progressive,0

Show Us Your Ethics,3,j5huzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/j5huzi/show_us_your_ethics/,1,1601926903.0,"I'm so disgusted with this constant beat down of the 99% by the 1%. Yes, not an original thought by far. The latest to get my blood boiling is the announcement by several major airlines that they plan to start furloughing workers. I'm not a Finance whiz but am I missing something here? Just scanning through publicly available information:

[Average & Median AA Salaries are](https://www.comparably.com/companies/american-airlines/salaries)= $128k/$117k. [Number of Estimated American Airline Announces Imminent Furloughs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/american-airlines-says-it-will-begin-furlough-of-19000-employees-as-hope-for-federal-help-fades/2020/09/30/6e632240-0340-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html) = 19,000 workers for 3 to 6 months = 119k* $117k * .25 (or .5) = $555.75 million (3 months) to $1.1 billion (6 months)

Ok, yes that's a lot. I can see how important it is to cut costs at a time when the airline has seen such a drastic decrease from an average share price in the $30's in March to about $10.7 in April 2020. I can only imagine that it has been barely making ends meet what with its stock price continuing to plummet, top executives foregoing pay to keep people employed because they've received no assistance from the federal government. 

Except No:

[Average AA Share Price April 1, 2020 and October 1, 2020 ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAL/american-airlines-group/stock-price-history) = $10.69/share and $12.58/share

[2019 Total Compensation of Top Five AA Execs](https://www1.salary.com/AMERICAN-AIRLINES-GROUP-INC-Executive-Salaries.html) = $30.9 million

[Stimulus Checks to AA in April 2020](https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-To-Receive-58-Billion-in-Payroll-Support-From-US-Department-of-the-Treasury-OPS-DIS-04/) = $4.8 billion

The love hasn’t wavered, but in recent years I have struggled with the respect part, and it’s kind of heartbreaking.

My Dad for example, is an intelligent and compassionate man, but he is also a devout Christian and is unable to separate church from state.  He is well-studied in multiple areas of science, but when presented with proven scientific facts that don’t jive with his religious beliefs, he denies them, saying the studies were flawed, or funded by biased groups or individuals.

He supports Trump and says he is voting to re-elect the president because “He has kept all of his promises,” and “he’s bringing jobs and God back to America.”

My Dad has always shown respect for women and minorities, but he doesn’t mind that Trump is openly opposite in those areas.

Racism has been the underside of America throughout our history. The manner with which we have treated Racism has led to our current moment. How we acknowledge and confront Racism today will have a major impact on our future. This means examining our institutional challenges, class struggles, and more, important, ourselves.

Please join us for this important and informative session, featuring two of the country's leading authorities on systemic racism.

Countering Bad Faith Argument About Child Abuse During Covid,42,im11kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/im11kf/countering_bad_faith_argument_about_child_abuse/,5,1599192339.0,"One of the arguments I'm hearing right now that I find utterly infuriating is that stay-at-home orders and the partial shutdowns the United States has been enacting on a state-by-state basis will contribute to putting more children in danger of abuse because they'll be at home more in stressful situations and won't have access to mandatory reporters like teachers.

This infuriates me because it often comes from people who make no reasonable efforts to counter child abuse at other times and it's clearly being made in bad faith, ""Won't somebody think of the children!?!"" but has enough logic behind it that I find it difficult to counter intellectually.

I do believe that local, state, and the federal governments should be taking this into consideration and providing resources to help mitigate the issue, but I also don't think it's in any way a justification for sending children back to school or into other potentially dangerous situations which could spread covid.

What are some good points to make when countering this argument and does anyone have any links to articles on the topic?

Feminist economics is both a research paradigm and a praxis: a political commitment to uncover women’s economic realities and to rectify the power structures that cause those realities, thereby increasing human well-being for both women and men.

The way the voting system works ensures the existence of massive, monolithic parties that everyone has to settle for.

I was surprised to see that so many Progressive organizations endorsed this Gomez because she never was clear on Medicare for all, did not endorse Bernie, supports Isreal 100%, and gave our local police department here in San Diego a $25 million dollar budget increase.

There was latter put out by the Bernie Delegates ([https://forms.gle/gjgWf7UNg3BmXLHM7](https://forms.gle/gjgWf7UNg3BmXLHM7)) that no organization has answered, and Gomez just put out her policy platform [https://georgettegomez.org/georgettes-bold-plan-for-america/](https://georgettegomez.org/georgettes-bold-plan-for-america/). That says quote ""it’s time to boldly reconstruct our healthcare system so it is affordable, accessible and universal.  We must move swiftly to extend open enrollment periods for the Affordable Care Act and move toward  making a Medicare for All public option available to bring down costs and protect coverage for families and small businesses.""

Gomez is doing an AMA tomorrow at 10 AM PDT I think we should ask her what she means.

A better pro-abortion argument,9,icl7r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/icl7r8/a_better_proabortion_argument/,20,1597862184.0,"Many people make this single argument when talking about abortion: 'Her body, her choice!' Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well. This is not fair for the baby similar to how it is not fair for a terminally ill to not have access to [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia). A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort. This argument applies even more to the USA as the cost of childbirth and care is enormous here with very little government support.

Also since this is a safe place to debate abortion, let me bust this common anti-abortion argument: BUt tHeN wHy kIlLing pregnant woMen counts as doUble mUrdEr? It's because we assume the child will not be aborted dummy, most pregnancies end with childbirth. A woman does not tell her intentions to abort to her murderer.",Progressive,0

In one year since adoption, nearly 300 plugs have been approved. Projects have not been built yet since the development and construction process takes a while but the effect is there.

Installing during construction is significantly cheaper than retrofit. Most often it is hardly noticeable when building since the cost increase is marginal to the total development cost. Retrofit requires much more labor and therefore costs more.

Feel free to comment any criticism! I'm always trying to get better.

* The video is titled “How to End White Privilege,” so I’m sure that’s what he’ll discuss
   * ...oh
* Hello, token black conservative!
* Immediately, he misunderstands the purpose of acknowledging white privilege
   * It’s not to feel good or virtue signal
   * It’s to better inform current and future policy
   * We don’t acknowledge gravity because it makes us feel better, we acknowledge it because
      * A) Doing so helps us understand and explain reality better
      * B) It helps us build better systems
   * We acknowledge white privilege because it helps us understand current racial divisions in the US and allows us to more effectively work towards remedying such issues
* He uses a lackluster definition: ""because you’re born with white skin, you have all these advantages I don’t have.""
   * By viewing a statistical/systemic issue from an anecdotal/individualistic approach, you’ve very effectively strawmanned the argument.
   * Wikipedia actually does a really good job at defining it: “White privilege is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.”
   * Wonder why they left that second piece out??
* Like what?
   * It’s interesting that he doesn’t touch on two of the most important issues facing black people
      * Unfair sentencing
      * Over policing
* “I got the house”
   * [Black owned firms are twice as likely to be rejected for loans according to the federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-september-availability-of-credit-to-small-businesses.htm)
   * [But he talked about houses: the pew research center found that black people were denied mortgages at almost 3 times the rate of white people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/10/blacks-and-hispanics-face-extra-challenges-in-getting-home-loans/)
   * OP, I hear you say, causation does not equal correlation. Maybe all of that comes down to wealth inequality, not race.
      * We know that
      * This means that if loan discrimination happened at some point in the (fairly recent) past, we would still be feeling the effect of it and it could largely account for this current disparity
* Which brings us to Redlining :(

      * Here’s how:
* “Blacks have more privilege than whites”
   * I’m interested to see where this goes. Maybe he’ll talk about college or something?
      * “It’s been my experience”
      * [Oh… so no real argument.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal)
   * Notice how PragerU sometimes doesn’t use real data for their figures/visuals/graphs

   * Also, he acts like normalizing white skin color as skin color doesn’t demean black people by treating white skin as default and accepted.
* “Today, these so called progressives dominate our colleges and universities.”
   * I wonder why progressivism dominates educated circles lol
* He just spends the next couple minutes misunderstanding the point of white privilege again.
* “How could this not create a victim mentality?”
   * I dunno, maybe if we fixed it instead of letting it fester
   * Also, are you saying we shouldn’t tell uncomfortable, studied truths?
      * Isn’t Conservatism all about uncomfortable truths? They don't call it the intellectual socially acceptable web.
* How come he accepts the existence of two-parent family privilege, American privilege, and good gene privilege yet fails to accept white privilege due to a counterpoint that applies equally to all of the above privileges?
   * He argues: Doesn’t **white privilege** depend on the person? If a **black lawyer and his wife** have a baby and a **meth addict, single white woman** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **white** one? Because he’s **white**? Cmon now!
   * Using his logic, you could say: Doesn’t **two-parent family privilege** depend on the person? If a **single lawyer mother** has a baby and a **meth addict, abusive couple** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with two parents**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **American privilege** depend on the person? If a **lawyer English couple** has a baby and a **meth addict, single American** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **American**? Because he’s **American**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **good gene privilege** depend on the person? If a **doctor couple who understand how to control heart issues but have genes with a higher risk of heart disease** have a baby and a **meth addict, single mother** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with better genes**? Because he’s **less likely to have heart issues**? Cmon now!
   * This is because all four examples are equally a privilege, but he tries to completely change the implication of privilege for white privilege:
      * Having a single privilege does not guarantee an easy life (there are way too many other factors), but it does mean that that one aspect of your life isn’t going to be what makes it harder for you than others.
* In the end, this video boils down to a few issues: a lack of understanding of why we identify white privilege, a lack of evidence for or against arguments, and a misunderstanding of what privilege even does.

Edit: PragerU does have sources on their [site](https://www.prageru.com/video/how-to-end-white-privilege/), but literally none of them are to back up quantitative claims, just qualitative opinions and one historical fact (the list of white privilege origins). It's a jumble of broken links, insanely partisan sources, appeals to authority, and (of course) none of them are peer reviewed. This source list is the epitome of feels over reals.",Progressive,0

A conversation with Dr. Benjamin Hunnicutt, a historian who documented the rise and fall of the pursuit of leisure time for all in the U.S.

Specifically, he focuses on the ""great mystery"" of why, after WW2, American political economy turned its back on the idea of leisure, and ever since, shorter working hours have disappeared from the discourse.

The conversation also explores: 

\- The developmental role of play in preparing humans for leisure time

\- The contrasting psychologies & ontologies of labor & leisure

I'm in shock.

As someone who positioned himself as a moral authority in my life, I feel betrayed. I cant stop thinking about it. It's been bothering me to the point where I feel like I can't stay silent, not just for me but for everyone who still sees this pastor as a moral authority in their own lives.

As a response, I've been trying to compile a list of reasonable (no hearsay, rumors or exaggerations) examples of Trump showing poor moral character, lying, abusing his position/ leveraging his power for selfish gain, or any other examples of him acting as a bad president or person. 

As you can imagine, this is a pretty big undertaking, so I'm turning to the intelligent people of reddit for help! If you have solid examples you can think of to add to the list, or any resources and references- could you help an internet stranger out?

It's infuriating hearing all the BS they spew that's been debunked for ages. It makes my blood boil when they trash people who are transgender.

* Current

More importantly, the letter misuses the term ""univariate"" and focuses on hyperbolic, emotionally charged language (like calling George Floyd ""the absolute worst specimen of [his] race and species""), and it contains no citations for its assertions, one of which is unsupported and another of which is plainly false (links below to corrections):

* The woman Floyd pointed his gun at was [not described as pregnant](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/06/12/george-floyd-criminal-record/).
* Donations to Black Lives Matter through ActBlue [do not filter to the Biden campaign or any other Democratic Party entities](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/jun/12/ryan-fournier/conservative-pundits-share-false-claim-about-black/).

Also, among several sentences supporting the Differential Involvement Hypothesis, this one stands out: ""Black people are not incarcerated at higher rates than their involvement in violent crime would predict."" Just by searching for that term (which I'll admit, I only knew about because of [a recent FiveThirtyEight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-police-see-issues-of-race-and-policing/)), I found a few studies that seem to say that although it's not completely wrong, the Differential Involvement Hypothesis does not come close to explaining differential treatment by police on the basis of race:

* ""[Racial Disparities in Arrests: A Race Specific Model Explaining Arrest Rates Across Black and White Young Adults](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10560-019-00618-7)"" (2019-05-03)
 * ""After controlling for contextual and behavioral factors, we still found Black young adults were arrested seven times more often than their White counterparts.""
* ""[A Test of the Differential Involvement Hypothesis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2153368717697104)"" (2017-03-20)
 * ""The results generated from the unconditional hierarchical model showed that the average self-reports of trouble with the police did not significantly vary across the neighborhoods.  The negative binomial results indicate that African Americans report significantly more trouble with the police while controlling for the respondents’ levels of offending, level of impulsivity, levels of anxiety and depression, gang membership, their family’s criminal involvement, whether they or their parents had serious mental health issues, the respondents’ current and expected economic conditions, their racial affinity, as well as other individual characteristics.""
* ""[Understanding Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Arrest: The Role of Individual, Home, School, and Community Characteristics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12552-016-9183-8)"" (2016-11-03)
 * ""Results showed significantly higher likelihood of having ever been arrested among blacks, when compared to whites, even after controlling for a range of delinquent behaviors&hellip;.""
* ""[Racial differences in speeding patterns: Exploring the differential offending hypothesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235212000554)"" (2012-06-16)
 * ""Analytic models indicated that Black drivers speed more frequently and engage in more severe speeding compared to White drivers, net of controls. &hellip; The findings suggest that citizen risk for specific police behavior is partially attributable to differential behavior prior to the encounter.""

"Concerned European here. I got into a heated debate on Twitter with a (self-proclaimed) ""unapologetic Conservative, Love Trump"" woman. I wanted to share bits of the conversation and share what I learnt of the mindset of such a person.",40,guauva,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/guauva/concerned_european_here_i_got_into_a_heated/,11,1591001787.0,"Yeah, I probably shouldnt even have engaged in a conversation with someone like that, especially as a non-American...

The again, the US have been shaping the entire world for such a long time, I feel us foreigners have earnt the right to criticize you when it's necessary. Especially as I'm someone who loves the country (well, I consider it to be the land of the best and the land of the worst, as I've told her) and has been closely following the situation (albeit from afar, but internet is a magical place) over the Atlantic for well over a decade.

Anyways, after she told me : ""*Now if you wish to discuss in an adult manner and not disparage my country or my President, I’ll listen and correct then misinformation you’ve been fed by liberal a\*\*clowns! If not... have a good day""*

I replied with : *""As I've said, I love your country, it's the land of the best and the land of the worst for me. I wont diss on the country, truly. Your president on the other hand is one of the worst scumbags our species has to offer. And he shouldnt be above criticism.""*

To which she said : ""*Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.""*

Which at first took me completely by surprise... so there are people out there who genuinely believe there is nothing one can reproach to Trump or criticize him on, that's... I mean... waw.

So, well, that was over half an hour ago and I've spent the last twenty minutes replying to her with all that came to my mind... and there is so much it was hell to begin with. It was interesting to me that the first thing that came to my mind what his telling to the 4 American Congresswomen (three of them were born in the US) to go back to their own country...

And then, after I typed those words, everything else flooded and I had to stop myself at some point. But yeah, that made me realize once more the strategy of that scumbag of a human being : drown every scandal with a bigger one so we dont know where to start with him.

Now... over six hours later, she replied. For my mental health, I dont want to discuss with such a person any further, but I felt like sharing some of the bits she answered me with... and truth be told, I wouldnt even know where to start replying to a person so far up their ass, I dont think it's even worth it... but still, there you go (keep in mind, all my posts were posted in succession six hours ago and she only replied to some now) : 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her : *Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.*

Me : *Just one ? I could go for ages, but at the top of my head: telling four American women (three of them who were born in the US mind you !) to go back to their country.  One more? Saying there are respectable people on both sides when nazis are concerned...* 

Her : *The respectable remark was a lie!  That is NOT what he said.  See, you get all the liberal spin, and the desire to believe everything you hear without research, (sheep).  You’re simply wrong* 

Me : *This could go on for ages... let's talk insulting a crippled reporter at a rally. Or forcing Ivanka's presence at a G7 summit where she had no place at all. Or Judge Curiel's affair... or asking for Obama's birth certificate... or just contradicting himself everytime he talks.* 

Her : *We have a law that you must be a natural born citizen to be POTUS, let me inform you that it was Hillary who brought up he wasn’t born here when she was running against him!* 

Me : *Or the hypocrisy at calling Obama on his golfing practice when he has spent a gazillion more times than him golfing. Again, the list could go for hours. I have a huge respect for America, but that man is an utter disgrace to the humankind. On every aspect.* 

Her :  *I could careless about golfing, except when an American had his head removed from his shoulders and Obama cried for the camera, turned and hit the fairway!* 

Me :  *Or using his position to blackmail assistance to a country in exchange for personal political gain. Or pardoning a war-criminal (Eddie Gallagher). Or the Stormy Daniels incident (I thought conservatives put more values than that on being a family man).* 

Her :  *Stormy Daniels said a few months ago, she lied... it never happened!*   
*You mean Ukraine, but I’m sorry... that’s been debunked.  Only radical lefties used that for impeachment purposes.  Not one word had been mentioned about Ukraine since!* 

Me :  *Oh yeah, I havent even mentioned the ""grab them by the pussy"" part. Or calling Covid a hoax when he had intel reports over two months previously. Or his blatant racism towards tenants back in 1973:*  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) 

Her :  *The hot mic moment? who cares? There’s not one man of power, and means who hasn’t taken advantage of that fact to get the most beautiful woman whom btw, have been giving it away to the highest bidder for ages!*  
*In 1973? Well damn... did you know the grand wizard of the KKK was friends with Biden and Hillary Clinton’s mentor? Give me a break.  We was barely out of segregation at that time.  Things, times and minds have evolved since then!*   
*The “hoax” mentioned, would you have heard the entire speech was that the democrats bi\*ching about Trump not taking steps early enough was a hoax! He did a China ban while Pelosi was telling people to “come to Chinatown”!* 

***Note : the following exchange was one of the very first one we had, but putting it here cause I think it's less relevant to  the overall conversation.*** 

Me : *As I've said, there's so many things to love about the US, but not only. For me, it's the land of the absolute best and the absolute worst our species has to offer. :)* 

Her : *That could be said about anywhere on the planet you picked. The difference between here and so many other places is we get to choose if we want to be an a\*\* or not! Gotta love freedom* 

Me : *But freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Freedom is not absolute. And before you jump on me, I'm French, I've quite verse with what freedom entails. Freedom of speech doesnt protect you from freedom of consequences of your speech for exemple.* 

Her :  *I agree, and with great freedom comes great responsibility and our press has forgot about that and all they want to do is malign, disparage and lie every chance they get and then print a retraction on pg 20 in small print, when they’re caught in the BS.* 

\-----------------------------------------------

So there you go... I'm not gonna waste anymore time debating with someone like that. It's exhausting and I've sadly come to questionning why I've wasted so much energy on a country that is not mine (even though I love it and would really wish to come and become a US citizen at some point, but damn, that is such a hard and discouraging thing to accomplish), but I felt like this convo needed to be shared so as much people as possible can have an insight (even if it's just one person) into how Trump boot-lickers think and see the world.

Have a great day, night or whatever, and keep up the good fight America, you got this and I'm sure you'll get out of it better and stronger.

Mass unemployment, racial tensions, and a general lack of faith in the legal system have boiled over and the result has been nothing short of anarchy.

I created an album of the statements of children in camps to raise money for the Young Center,15,gnbuxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/gnbuxn/i_created_an_album_of_the_statements_of_children/,2,1590012077.0,"[The Icebox and the Doghouse - Joshua Kirch](https://joshuakirch.bandcamp.com/album/the-icebox-and-the-doghouse)

This is a collection of statements of detainees (usually children) in ICE detention centers. These statements were made to their lawyers, and are available at  [www.project-amplify.org](https://www.project-amplify.org/) .

Any proceeds from purchases of this album will be given directly to The Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights, and will help with legal fees and providing child advocates to those detained. [www.theyoungcenter.org](https://www.theyoungcenter.org/)

\----Less formally, the album is due to wanting to do \*something\* to help. To know that children are waking up (assuming they got any sleep) scared and in cages, often forcefully separated from their families- it's heartbreaking. Not only do I feel compelled to help as best I can, but we also thought that it's important for people to hear their stories, what they're going through.

The title is based on two of the names that the residents had for these facilities.",Progressive,0

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts.

Important PSA: Do not treat tear gas or pepper sprays with the following items,10,iuhl62,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iuhl62/important_psa_do_not_treat_tear_gas_or_pepper/,0,1600370865.0,"*This is taken from the book Riot Medicine, if you have any scientific data to contradict the information presented. I will add it.*

Note: RCA means Riot Control Agent, which is the technical term for things like tear gas and pepper spray.

* **LAW/Maalox:**   Liquid antacid and water (LAW) is a mixture of 50% liquid antacid and 50% water. In some countries, LAW is simply referred to as Maalox \[the name of a popular brand of liquid antacid.\] LAW is an extremely popular treatment, in part because of its simplicity and the minor cooling sensation patients report when LAW is applied to the skin. Liquid antacid does not belong in the eyes, and although rare, ingredients in antacids may cause an allergic reaction. Research on  pain relief provided by topical application of antacid is mixed. One study showed no significant decrease in pain for patients exposed to OC spray after applying liquid antacid. Another showed statistically significant decrease in pain up to the 60 minute mark, but Riot Control Agent   Contamination concluded “the difference in \[pain levels\] may have questionable clinical significance.” Anecdotal evidence supports the idea that LAW decreases pain for OC spray on the skin, but it is not recommended even if it is marginally more effective.
* **Baby Shampoo:**   Baby shampoo has not been shown to be effective when used in the eyes or on the skin for treating either pepper spray or tear gas.
* **FAST:** Fixative antacid surfactant treatment (FAST) is a pepper spray remedy originally published on It’s Going Down. FAST was de-signed to be a more effective alternative to LAW that combined the active ingredients of antacid, sunflower lecithin, and baby shampoo. While there was some   experimentation done by the creators to determine whether this treatment was effective, it lacked the rigor be make conclusions. More generally, research on the individual active ingredients suggests that they do not  provide a statistically significant decrease in pain.
* **Cow's Milk:** Plain cow’s milk is another common treatment for pepper spray and tear gas. Pouring milk into the eyes has risk of infection, and this is especially true on hot days where the milk will not remain refrigerated before use. The stickiness and stench of milk is another downside of using milk as a decontaminant. Most importantly, cow’s milk used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been show to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Oils:** Mineral oil followed immediately by alcohol (MOFIBA) is an outdated treatment for pepper spray contamination that is no longer used by most medics. The treatment worked by covering small patches of skin with mineral oil to attract pepper spray, then removing it with rubbing   alcohol. This was retired from use because if done incorrectly can cause additional pain over pepper spray alone. Similarly, people have used vegetable oil to wash the affected area, wiping the residue off after, and this should not be done either. Both of these methods are harmful because oil will trap the RCA against the skin.
* **Onions:** Onions have been inaccurately reported as effective against tear gas. This belief seems to be most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa. The reported procedure is to breath over whole or cut onions, and in particular to use onions themselves as part of improvised gas masks to mitigate the effects of inhaling tear gas. RCAs, and in particular tear gas, are lachrymators.  Chopped onion releases a chemical which is also a lachrymator. Onions do not mitigate or prevent   the effects of tear gas.
* **Vinegar:** Vinegar is another commonly suggested ineffective remedy and preventative measure for tear gas inhalation. Activists suggest using it as a decontaminant on affected skin. It has been suggested to soak a bandana in vinegar then breath through it to prevent inhalation of tear gas.  Like tear gas, vinegar is a lachrymator. Vinegar vapor irritates the eyes, and prolonged inhalation will irritate the lungs.
* **Citrus:** Lemon and lime have been suggested to be used like vinegar, both as a decontaminant wash for the skin and with a bandana as a filter for tear gas. There is no evidence either of these have any effect on reducing the irritation associated with tear gas or preventing inhalation.
* **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Hydrogen peroxide is another remedy used by activists and medics to treat tear gas and pepper spray. There is no evidence that this has any effect on either, and further, it will cause additional burning sensations if it gets into the eyes or other mucous membranes. Given   that pepper spray is mainly aimed at the face and tear gas affects the eyes, nose, and mouth, there is high risk of causing additional harm to the patient even if it was an effective treatment.
* **Lidocaine:** Lidocaine in particular when used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been shown to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Miscellaneous:** Some activists have suggested a variety of treatments such as using baking soda paste, topical analgesics, or toothpaste to treat affected areas. These are not recommended as they trap RCAs against the skin and may worsen its effects.

I would strongly suggest you read Riot Medicine's section on RCAs to help  deal with protection and treatment. But I'll provide a summary.

**Protection**

Typically protesters will use goggles and a half-mask respirator or disposable respirator. If these are not available, a hat, glasses, and bandana will still offer a moderate amount of protection. A wet bandana made of a fabric with a tight weave held over the mouth will filter a modest mount of tear gas from the air.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that slow, shallow breaths helps minimize the effects of tear gas on the lungs. Patients have reported feeling the immediate urge to vomit after taking deep breaths in the presence of tear gas and that the feeling persisted until they were able to spend significant time breathing fresh air.

**Treatment**

In general, use water or saline (Manufactured salt water used for medical purposes)

* If you're helping others, introduce yourself first and obtain consent to help, if they are unable to give consent. Do not force treatment onto people. If someone is unconscious you can assume consent, but you have bigger problems to deal with than RCAs.
* Remove yourself/the patient from the area the gas or spray is to an area with fresh air to prevent further damage.
* Do not touch the affected areas.
* Allow tear and mucus production, and allow coughing and sneezing. If you or the patient is asthmatic, use an inhaler.
* Remove and clean contact lenses, possibly dispose of them.
* Decontamination: If it's CR, attempt to brush and dust off as much as possible. Avoid use of water or other liquids to decontaminate the patient unless they are already wet or sweaty, or the RCA is in their eyes (which are  already wet). If not, flush the body part with large amounts of water. For parts of the body other than the eyes, spraying large amounts of water on the affected body part is sufficient.
* Rinse the mouth. Even in the absence of burning or irritating sensations in the mouth, it still helps.

Countering Bad Faith Argument About Child Abuse During Covid,40,im11kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/im11kf/countering_bad_faith_argument_about_child_abuse/,5,1599192339.0,"One of the arguments I'm hearing right now that I find utterly infuriating is that stay-at-home orders and the partial shutdowns the United States has been enacting on a state-by-state basis will contribute to putting more children in danger of abuse because they'll be at home more in stressful situations and won't have access to mandatory reporters like teachers.

This infuriates me because it often comes from people who make no reasonable efforts to counter child abuse at other times and it's clearly being made in bad faith, ""Won't somebody think of the children!?!"" but has enough logic behind it that I find it difficult to counter intellectually.

I do believe that local, state, and the federal governments should be taking this into consideration and providing resources to help mitigate the issue, but I also don't think it's in any way a justification for sending children back to school or into other potentially dangerous situations which could spread covid.

What are some good points to make when countering this argument and does anyone have any links to articles on the topic?

Feminist economics is oriented towards the goal of “enhancing the well-being of children, women, and men in local, national, and transnational communities.”

Feminist economics is both a research paradigm and a praxis: a political commitment to uncover women’s economic realities and to rectify the power structures that cause those realities, thereby increasing human well-being for both women and men.

Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well. This is not fair for the baby similar to how it is not fair for a terminally ill to not have access to [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia). A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort. This argument applies even more to the USA as the cost of childbirth and care is enormous here with very little government support.

Also since this is a safe place to debate abortion, let me bust this common anti-abortion argument: BUt tHeN wHy kIlLing pregnant woMen counts as doUble mUrdEr?

Feel free to comment any criticism! I'm always trying to get better.

* The video is titled “How to End White Privilege,” so I’m sure that’s what he’ll discuss
   * ...oh
* Hello, token black conservative!
* Immediately, he misunderstands the purpose of acknowledging white privilege
   * It’s not to feel good or virtue signal
   * It’s to better inform current and future policy
   * We don’t acknowledge gravity because it makes us feel better, we acknowledge it because
      * A) Doing so helps us understand and explain reality better
      * B) It helps us build better systems
   * We acknowledge white privilege because it helps us understand current racial divisions in the US and allows us to more effectively work towards remedying such issues
* He uses a lackluster definition: ""because you’re born with white skin, you have all these advantages I don’t have.""
   * By viewing a statistical/systemic issue from an anecdotal/individualistic approach, you’ve very effectively strawmanned the argument.
   * Wikipedia actually does a really good job at defining it: “White privilege is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.”
   * Wonder why they left that second piece out??
* Like what?
   * It’s interesting that he doesn’t touch on two of the most important issues facing black people
      * Unfair sentencing
      * Over policing
* “I got the house”
   * [Black owned firms are twice as likely to be rejected for loans according to the federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-september-availability-of-credit-to-small-businesses.htm)
   * [But he talked about houses: the pew research center found that black people were denied mortgages at almost 3 times the rate of white people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/10/blacks-and-hispanics-face-extra-challenges-in-getting-home-loans/)
   * OP, I hear you say, causation does not equal correlation. Maybe all of that comes down to wealth inequality, not race.
      * We know that
      * This means that if loan discrimination happened at some point in the (fairly recent) past, we would still be feeling the effect of it and it could largely account for this current disparity
* Which brings us to Redlining :(
   * “I’ve never heard of such a banker”
      * [Well, on the loan side, you have redlining, it all started when the Federal Housing Administration refused to insure mortgages in/near black neighborhoods. ](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * [From there banks ran with it: they would not provide loans to anybody in these neighborhoods (even though “redlined” areas weren’t all more likely to default on loans)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5FBJyqfoLM)
      * [Then, many neighborhoods would disallow many black people from buying a house because it would devalue the surrounding properties (even neighborhoods that the FHA subsidized)](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * This happened until the mid to late sixties?!?!?!?
* Suspicion in a store
   * Studies show that black people are believed to be more suspicious with the same amount of evidence
      * [mock jurors were given the same evidence for a case but the surveillance footage showed either a dark skinned or a light skinned person. ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601615)
      * [In another study, entry level criminal justice students found photos of light skinned inmates more trustworthy than dark skinned inmates.](https://ir.ua.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/3276/file_1.pdf)
* “What if I had a **store** that had a history of **being shoplifted** by **young black women**, and a **young black woman** with a bad attitude **walked in**? Would I **be suspicious**? Yea I would… I call that common sense.”
   * Just wanted to point out that this argument can be used to justify racial profiling, which would perpetuate racial crime disparities
      * Here’s how:
* “Blacks have more privilege than whites”
   * I’m interested to see where this goes. Maybe he’ll talk about college or something?
      * “It’s been my experience”
      * [Oh… so no real argument.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal)
   * Notice how PragerU sometimes doesn’t use real data for their figures/visuals/graphs
      * It’s almost like they dont’t have any data to support some of the claims they make
* “If two people are equally qualified for a job, the black person will usually get it.”
   * No data again? No problem, I have some.
      * [The National Bureau of Economic Research found that the same application with a white sounding name gets 50% more callbacks than with an african-american sounding name.](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html)

* “If you deny this, you’re denying reality” says the man with zero sources lol
* For the mcintosh/bandage example, I like how they pick the weakest one
   * [Here is the actual, full paper](https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mcintosh.pdf)
   * Also, he acts like normalizing white skin color as skin color doesn’t demean black people by treating white skin as default and accepted.
* “Today, these so called progressives dominate our colleges and universities.”
   * I wonder why progressivism dominates educated circles lol
* He just spends the next couple minutes misunderstanding the point of white privilege again.
* “How could this not create a victim mentality?”
   * I dunno, maybe if we fixed it instead of letting it fester
   * Also, are you saying we shouldn’t tell uncomfortable, studied truths?
      * Isn’t Conservatism all about uncomfortable truths? They don't call it the intellectual socially acceptable web.
* How come he accepts the existence of two-parent family privilege, American privilege, and good gene privilege yet fails to accept white privilege due to a counterpoint that applies equally to all of the above privileges?
   * He argues: Doesn’t **white privilege** depend on the person? If a **black lawyer and his wife** have a baby and a **meth addict, single white woman** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **white** one? Because he’s **white**? Cmon now!
   * Using his logic, you could say: Doesn’t **two-parent family privilege** depend on the person? If a **single lawyer mother** has a baby and a **meth addict, abusive couple** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with two parents**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **American privilege** depend on the person? If a **lawyer English couple** has a baby and a **meth addict, single American** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **American**? Because he’s **American**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **good gene privilege** depend on the person? If a **doctor couple who understand how to control heart issues but have genes with a higher risk of heart disease** have a baby and a **meth addict, single mother** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with better genes**? Because he’s **less likely to have heart issues**? Cmon now!
   * This is because all four examples are equally a privilege, but he tries to completely change the implication of privilege for white privilege:
      * Having a single privilege does not guarantee an easy life (there are way too many other factors), but it does mean that that one aspect of your life isn’t going to be what makes it harder for you than others.
* In the end, this video boils down to a few issues: a lack of understanding of why we identify white privilege, a lack of evidence for or against arguments, and a misunderstanding of what privilege even does.

Edit: PragerU does have sources on their [site](https://www.prageru.com/video/how-to-end-white-privilege/), but literally none of them are to back up quantitative claims, just qualitative opinions and one historical fact (the list of white privilege origins). It's a jumble of broken links, insanely partisan sources, appeals to authority, and (of course) none of them are peer reviewed. This source list is the epitome of feels over reals.",Progressive,0

"Why has the dialogue on police reform polarized itself into the opposed stances of ""Law enforcement officers are absolute. All the protestors are rioters and deserve to be shot."" and ""Law enforcement should be abolished. All law enforcement officers are bastards and deserve to be shot.""?",2,huwp1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/huwp1f/why_has_the_dialogue_on_police_reform_polarized/,2,1595317729.0,"This is more of a venting of frustrations than anything else. I felt like at the beginning of these protests, the majority of people were willing to have a reasonable dialogue about police reform, where-in it was generally agreed that the scope of police powers and the militarization of law enforcement should be decreased, and that alternative social assistance programs should be brought up in place of where law enforcement have been acting in cases where the monopoly on violence of the state is necessary. I could and can and did and do agree with that sentiment. Reform the police. Reduce law enforcement funding. Reduce law enforcement militarization. Great. Do it. Wonderful.

So why has this dialogue been polarized so much? It's a rhetorical question, of course, since I know the reason that it's been polarized is because of months of conflict, stress, and violence continuing to push people to further and further extremes, but it's still so *frustrating*. Why are we all engaging in mass campaigns of dehumanization against those standing across from us? Why are we actively calling for the blood of our ""enemies"" to be spilt? Why do we think that our only options are no reform or abolition, reaction or revolution?

Again, I'm just frustrated, and needed to get this off my chest in a community that (I hope) understands my general positions. It gets to the point where I actively begin to doubt myself because I don't see anybody holding the same positions we started with two months ago. Am I in the wrong? Maybe. I don't know. But I wish that the people telling me that I'm wrong could do so without rabid spittle flying from their mouths as they do so, declaring me an enemy of the people if I refuse to side with them on the matter.",Progressive,0

My own family commented in support!

I'm in shock.

As someone who positioned himself as a moral authority in my life, I feel betrayed. I cant stop thinking about it. It's been bothering me to the point where I feel like I can't stay silent, not just for me but for everyone who still sees this pastor as a moral authority in their own lives.

As a response, I've been trying to compile a list of reasonable (no hearsay, rumors or exaggerations) examples of Trump showing poor moral character, lying, abusing his position/ leveraging his power for selfish gain, or any other examples of him acting as a bad president or person. 

As you can imagine, this is a pretty big undertaking, so I'm turning to the intelligent people of reddit for help! If you have solid examples you can think of to add to the list, or any resources and references- could you help an internet stranger out?

Thanks beautiful people!",Progressive,0

It's infuriating hearing all the BS they spew that's been debunked for ages. It makes my blood boil when they trash people who are transgender. It makes me want to punch something when they actually think a black man has no excuse for being poor because there are black colleges, and black only grant, and a month devoted to black history.


They are the dumbest bunch of maga toting neckbeards!


The worst part? I can't say a damn thing. If I say something, suddenly it's ME who is causing problems. I'LL be the one who is making people uncomfortable at work. I will be the one blamed. I'll be blacklisted at work and put my job in jeopardy.


The sad part is, I agree with maybe 10% of the things they say. For example, I think racist statues should be removed and put in a museum somewhere but not destroyed by a mob.

Obviously, as I noted, I am looking for realistic responses; which importantly noted that the VP is almost guaranteed to be a female and probably another marginalized identity (LGBT, POC, etc.)as well (cause identity politics, yay). Don’t get me wrong, I am all for those things I just think this supposed pledge by Biden is pandering and that’s it, but anywho...

So, for me I’ve been trying to go through all the realistic potential picks and it seems like the top 3 most progressive are Abrams, Warren and Baldwin. However, with Warren I feel like she kind of lost a lot of her progressive credibility due to her actions during the primaries. Personally, I feel like the best choice, for progressives, would be Baldwin. However, while I believe she does have a “realistic” chance she also definitely has the lowest chance too.

The again, the US have been shaping the entire world for such a long time, I feel us foreigners have earnt the right to criticize you when it's necessary. Especially as I'm someone who loves the country (well, I consider it to be the land of the best and the land of the worst, as I've told her) and has been closely following the situation (albeit from afar, but internet is a magical place) over the Atlantic for well over a decade.

Anyways, after she told me : ""*Now if you wish to discuss in an adult manner and not disparage my country or my President, I’ll listen and correct then misinformation you’ve been fed by liberal a\*\*clowns! If not... have a good day""*

I replied with : *""As I've said, I love your country, it's the land of the best and the land of the worst for me. I wont diss on the country, truly. Your president on the other hand is one of the worst scumbags our species has to offer. And he shouldnt be above criticism.""*

To which she said : ""*Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.""*

Which at first took me completely by surprise... so there are people out there who genuinely believe there is nothing one can reproach to Trump or criticize him on, that's... I mean... waw.

So, well, that was over half an hour ago and I've spent the last twenty minutes replying to her with all that came to my mind... and there is so much it was hell to begin with. It was interesting to me that the first thing that came to my mind what his telling to the 4 American Congresswomen (three of them were born in the US) to go back to their own country...

And then, after I typed those words, everything else flooded and I had to stop myself at some point. But yeah, that made me realize once more the strategy of that scumbag of a human being : drown every scandal with a bigger one so we dont know where to start with him.

Now... over six hours later, she replied. For my mental health, I dont want to discuss with such a person any further, but I felt like sharing some of the bits she answered me with... and truth be told, I wouldnt even know where to start replying to a person so far up their ass, I dont think it's even worth it... but still, there you go (keep in mind, all my posts were posted in succession six hours ago and she only replied to some now) : 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her : *Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.*

Me : *Just one ? I could go for ages, but at the top of my head: telling four American women (three of them who were born in the US mind you !) to go back to their country.  One more? Saying there are respectable people on both sides when nazis are concerned...* 

Her : *The respectable remark was a lie!  That is NOT what he said.  See, you get all the liberal spin, and the desire to believe everything you hear without research, (sheep).  You’re simply wrong* 

Me : *This could go on for ages... let's talk insulting a crippled reporter at a rally. Or forcing Ivanka's presence at a G7 summit where she had no place at all. Or Judge Curiel's affair... or asking for Obama's birth certificate... or just contradicting himself everytime he talks.* 

Her : *We have a law that you must be a natural born citizen to be POTUS, let me inform you that it was Hillary who brought up he wasn’t born here when she was running against him!* 

Me : *Or the hypocrisy at calling Obama on his golfing practice when he has spent a gazillion more times than him golfing. Again, the list could go for hours. I have a huge respect for America, but that man is an utter disgrace to the humankind. On every aspect.* 

Her :  *I could careless about golfing, except when an American had his head removed from his shoulders and Obama cried for the camera, turned and hit the fairway!* 

Me :  *Or using his position to blackmail assistance to a country in exchange for personal political gain. Or pardoning a war-criminal (Eddie Gallagher). Or the Stormy Daniels incident (I thought conservatives put more values than that on being a family man).* 

Her :  *Stormy Daniels said a few months ago, she lied... it never happened!*   
*You mean Ukraine, but I’m sorry... that’s been debunked.  Only radical lefties used that for impeachment purposes.  Not one word had been mentioned about Ukraine since!* 

Me :  *Oh yeah, I havent even mentioned the ""grab them by the pussy"" part. Or calling Covid a hoax when he had intel reports over two months previously. Or his blatant racism towards tenants back in 1973:*  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) 

Her :  *The hot mic moment? who cares? There’s not one man of power, and means who hasn’t taken advantage of that fact to get the most beautiful woman whom btw, have been giving it away to the highest bidder for ages!*  
*In 1973? Well damn... did you know the grand wizard of the KKK was friends with Biden and Hillary Clinton’s mentor? Give me a break.  We was barely out of segregation at that time.  Things, times and minds have evolved since then!*   
*The “hoax” mentioned, would you have heard the entire speech was that the democrats bi\*ching about Trump not taking steps early enough was a hoax! He did a China ban while Pelosi was telling people to “come to Chinatown”!* 

***Note : the following exchange was one of the very first one we had, but putting it here cause I think it's less relevant to  the overall conversation.*** 

Me : *As I've said, there's so many things to love about the US, but not only. For me, it's the land of the absolute best and the absolute worst our species has to offer. :)* 

Her : *That could be said about anywhere on the planet you picked. The difference between here and so many other places is we get to choose if we want to be an a\*\* or not! Gotta love freedom* 

Me : *But freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Freedom is not absolute. And before you jump on me, I'm French, I've quite verse with what freedom entails. Freedom of speech doesnt protect you from freedom of consequences of your speech for exemple.* 

Her :  *I agree, and with great freedom comes great responsibility and our press has forgot about that and all they want to do is malign, disparage and lie every chance they get and then print a retraction on pg 20 in small print, when they’re caught in the BS.* 

\-----------------------------------------------

So there you go... I'm not gonna waste anymore time debating with someone like that. It's exhausting and I've sadly come to questionning why I've wasted so much energy on a country that is not mine (even though I love it and would really wish to come and become a US citizen at some point, but damn, that is such a hard and discouraging thing to accomplish), but I felt like this convo needed to be shared so as much people as possible can have an insight (even if it's just one person) into how Trump boot-lickers think and see the world.

Have a great day, night or whatever, and keep up the good fight America, you got this and I'm sure you'll get out of it better and stronger.

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Planet Earth has a finite ecological base with finite exploitable resources.  Our world economic systen requires open-ended economic growth to maintain it's existance. The creation of financial instruments to fund the exploitation of non-renewable resources is tantamount to comiting economic suicide. The analogy is an alcoholic saying that he feels good and that nothing bad will happen to him.  Some conomists give humanity 10 years to migrate to a sustainable economy, after which econmic hardship will exponentially expand for humanity.  See [https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/](https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/).  

&#x200B;

The United States, which should be a leader in helping to bring about about an more sustainable economic system based on renewable sources of energy and renewable resources has instead ""walked the paper backward"" over the last 4 years.  Regime change is in the wind. Curren polls indicate a hopeful oucome.  See [https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls), but let us take nothing for granted.

&#x200B;

There is a window of opportunity remaining, and you can still make a difference.  Encourage soft supporters of the current regime to sit up and take notice of the satirical visuals and narrative at [commandercovid.com](https://commandercovid.com).  Satire, properly marketed, can be an effective force for positive social change.  Keep the Faith!",Progressive,0

If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts.

The AvengeHer Plan,6,iw083v,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iw083v/the_avengeher_plan/,1,1600576335.0,"(First, abolish the filibuster.)

1. The lower circuit courts of appeals have a wild disparity in number of judges in relation to population. The 11th circuit has one judge for every 2.7 million people while the 10th circuit has one judge for every 1.4 million. This should be made uniform, 1 judge for every million people in a circuit, with a circuit capped at 21 judges with a minimum of 11. Every ten years after the census the courts should be expanded to account for population growth.
2. That means that there should be approximately 332 appeals court judges not 179. This should be spread over 16 circuit courts not 12 plus the Federal and DC Circuit courts which should be brought up to the maximum of 21 judges. This means we need to confirm 172 new appeals court judges to bring population balance to the appeals courts.
3. The Supreme Court use to have a judge to account for each circuit court. Today each Supreme Court Justices is assigned a circuit court to cover with some having to cover multiple courts. This is an unreasonable burden to place on the justices so the court should be expanded so there is one Supreme Court justice for every circuit court.
4. That means there should be 18 Supreme Court Justices and we'll need to confirm an additional 9 justices to meet the requirements of the new law. Every ten years after the census a Supreme Court member will be added to account for any growth in the circuit courts.

We will be establishing some much needed equal representation to the circuit courts and returning the Supreme Court to its traditional role of representing the size of the circuit courts. It's a reasonable plan based on tradition and equality of representation. Also Fuck Mitch McConnell.",Progressive,0

Countering Bad Faith Argument About Child Abuse During Covid,39,im11kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/im11kf/countering_bad_faith_argument_about_child_abuse/,5,1599192339.0,"One of the arguments I'm hearing right now that I find utterly infuriating is that stay-at-home orders and the partial shutdowns the United States has been enacting on a state-by-state basis will contribute to putting more children in danger of abuse because they'll be at home more in stressful situations and won't have access to mandatory reporters like teachers.

This infuriates me because it often comes from people who make no reasonable efforts to counter child abuse at other times and it's clearly being made in bad faith, ""Won't somebody think of the children!?!"" but has enough logic behind it that I find it difficult to counter intellectually.

I do believe that local, state, and the federal governments should be taking this into consideration and providing resources to help mitigate the issue, but I also don't think it's in any way a justification for sending children back to school or into other potentially dangerous situations which could spread covid.

What are some good points to make when countering this argument and does anyone have any links to articles on the topic?

Feminist economics is oriented towards the goal of “enhancing the well-being of children, women, and men in local, national, and transnational communities.”

Feminist economics is both a research paradigm and a praxis: a political commitment to uncover women’s economic realities and to rectify the power structures that cause those realities, thereby increasing human well-being for both women and men.

A better pro-abortion argument,8,icl7r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/icl7r8/a_better_proabortion_argument/,20,1597862184.0,"Many people make this single argument when talking about abortion: 'Her body, her choice!' Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well. This is not fair for the baby similar to how it is not fair for a terminally ill to not have access to [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia). A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort. This argument applies even more to the USA as the cost of childbirth and care is enormous here with very little government support.

Also since this is a safe place to debate abortion, let me bust this common anti-abortion argument: BUt tHeN wHy kIlLing pregnant woMen counts as doUble mUrdEr?

In one year since adoption, nearly 300 plugs have been approved. Projects have not been built yet since the development and construction process takes a while but the effect is there.

Installing during construction is significantly cheaper than retrofit. Most often it is hardly noticeable when building since the cost increase is marginal to the total development cost. Retrofit requires much more labor and therefore costs more.

"A response to PragerU's ""How to End White Privilege""",104,hxnsf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/hxnsf7/a_response_to_pragerus_how_to_end_white_privilege/,30,1595716872.0,"[Here is the original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18IVjGz9Gvk)

Feel free to comment any criticism! I'm always trying to get better.

* The video is titled “How to End White Privilege,” so I’m sure that’s what he’ll discuss
   * ...oh
* Hello, token black conservative!
* Immediately, he misunderstands the purpose of acknowledging white privilege
   * It’s not to feel good or virtue signal
   * It’s to better inform current and future policy
   * We don’t acknowledge gravity because it makes us feel better, we acknowledge it because
      * A) Doing so helps us understand and explain reality better
      * B) It helps us build better systems
   * We acknowledge white privilege because it helps us understand current racial divisions in the US and allows us to more effectively work towards remedying such issues
* He uses a lackluster definition: ""because you’re born with white skin, you have all these advantages I don’t have.""
   * By viewing a statistical/systemic issue from an anecdotal/individualistic approach, you’ve very effectively strawmanned the argument.
   * Wikipedia actually does a really good job at defining it: “White privilege is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.”
   * Wonder why they left that second piece out??
* Like what?
   * It’s interesting that he doesn’t touch on two of the most important issues facing black people
      * Unfair sentencing
      * Over policing
* “I got the house”
   * [Black owned firms are twice as likely to be rejected for loans according to the federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2017-september-availability-of-credit-to-small-businesses.htm)
   * [But he talked about houses: the pew research center found that black people were denied mortgages at almost 3 times the rate of white people](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/10/blacks-and-hispanics-face-extra-challenges-in-getting-home-loans/)
   * OP, I hear you say, causation does not equal correlation. Maybe all of that comes down to wealth inequality, not race.
      * We know that
      * This means that if loan discrimination happened at some point in the (fairly recent) past, we would still be feeling the effect of it and it could largely account for this current disparity
* Which brings us to Redlining :(
   * “I’ve never heard of such a banker”
      * [Well, on the loan side, you have redlining, it all started when the Federal Housing Administration refused to insure mortgages in/near black neighborhoods. ](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * [From there banks ran with it: they would not provide loans to anybody in these neighborhoods (even though “redlined” areas weren’t all more likely to default on loans)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5FBJyqfoLM)
      * [Then, many neighborhoods would disallow many black people from buying a house because it would devalue the surrounding properties (even neighborhoods that the FHA subsidized)](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)
      * This happened until the mid to late sixties?!?!?!?
* Suspicion in a store
   * Studies show that black people are believed to be more suspicious with the same amount of evidence
      * [mock jurors were given the same evidence for a case but the surveillance footage showed either a dark skinned or a light skinned person. ](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1601615)
      * [In another study, entry level criminal justice students found photos of light skinned inmates more trustworthy than dark skinned inmates.](https://ir.ua.edu/bitstream/handle/123456789/3276/file_1.pdf)
* “What if I had a **store** that had a history of **being shoplifted** by **young black women**, and a **young black woman** with a bad attitude **walked in**? Would I **be suspicious**? Yea I would… I call that common sense.”
   * Just wanted to point out that this argument can be used to justify racial profiling, which would perpetuate racial crime disparities
      * Here’s how:
* “Blacks have more privilege than whites”
   * I’m interested to see where this goes. Maybe he’ll talk about college or something?
      * “It’s been my experience”
      * [Oh… so no real argument.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal)
   * Notice how PragerU sometimes doesn’t use real data for their figures/visuals/graphs
      * It’s almost like they dont’t have any data to support some of the claims they make
* “If two people are equally qualified for a job, the black person will usually get it.”
   * No data again? No problem, I have some.
      * [The National Bureau of Economic Research found that the same application with a white sounding name gets 50% more callbacks than with an african-american sounding name.](https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/w9873.html)
      * [Another study found that](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/000312240907400505) 
* “If you deny this, you’re denying reality” says the man with zero sources lol
* For the mcintosh/bandage example, I like how they pick the weakest one
   * [Here is the actual, full paper](https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/mcintosh.pdf)
   * Also, he acts like normalizing white skin color as skin color doesn’t demean black people by treating white skin as default and accepted.
* “Today, these so called progressives dominate our colleges and universities.”
   * I wonder why progressivism dominates educated circles lol
* He just spends the next couple minutes misunderstanding the point of white privilege again.
* “How could this not create a victim mentality?”
   * I dunno, maybe if we fixed it instead of letting it fester
   * Also, are you saying we shouldn’t tell uncomfortable, studied truths?
      * Isn’t Conservatism all about uncomfortable truths? They don't call it the intellectual socially acceptable web.
* How come he accepts the existence of two-parent family privilege, American privilege, and good gene privilege yet fails to accept white privilege due to a counterpoint that applies equally to all of the above privileges?
   * He argues: Doesn’t **white privilege** depend on the person? If a **black lawyer and his wife** have a baby and a **meth addict, single white woman** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **white** one? Because he’s **white**? Cmon now!
   * Using his logic, you could say: Doesn’t **two-parent family privilege** depend on the person? If a **single lawyer mother** has a baby and a **meth addict, abusive couple** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with two parents**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **American privilege** depend on the person? If a **lawyer English couple** has a baby and a **meth addict, single American** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **American**? Because he’s **American**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **good gene privilege** depend on the person? If a **doctor couple who understand how to control heart issues but have genes with a higher risk of heart disease** have a baby and a **meth addict, single mother** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with better genes**? Because he’s **less likely to have heart issues**? Cmon now!
   * This is because all four examples are equally a privilege, but he tries to completely change the implication of privilege for white privilege:
      * Having a single privilege does not guarantee an easy life (there are way too many other factors), but it does mean that that one aspect of your life isn’t going to be what makes it harder for you than others.
* In the end, this video boils down to a few issues: a lack of understanding of why we identify white privilege, a lack of evidence for or against arguments, and a misunderstanding of what privilege even does.

Edit: PragerU does have sources on their [site](https://www.prageru.com/video/how-to-end-white-privilege/), but literally none of them are to back up quantitative claims, just qualitative opinions and one historical fact (the list of white privilege origins). It's a jumble of broken links, insanely partisan sources, appeals to authority, and (of course) none of them are peer reviewed. This source list is the epitome of feels over reals.",Progressive,0

I'm in shock.

As someone who positioned himself as a moral authority in my life, I feel betrayed. I cant stop thinking about it. It's been bothering me to the point where I feel like I can't stay silent, not just for me but for everyone who still sees this pastor as a moral authority in their own lives.

As a response, I've been trying to compile a list of reasonable (no hearsay, rumors or exaggerations) examples of Trump showing poor moral character, lying, abusing his position/ leveraging his power for selfish gain, or any other examples of him acting as a bad president or person. 

As you can imagine, this is a pretty big undertaking, so I'm turning to the intelligent people of reddit for help! If you have solid examples you can think of to add to the list, or any resources and references- could you help an internet stranger out?

It's infuriating hearing all the BS they spew that's been debunked for ages. It makes my blood boil when they trash people who are transgender. It makes me want to punch something when they actually think a black man has no excuse for being poor because there are black colleges, and black only grant, and a month devoted to black history.


They are the dumbest bunch of maga toting neckbeards!


The worst part? I can't say a damn thing. If I say something, suddenly it's ME who is causing problems. I'LL be the one who is making people uncomfortable at work. I will be the one blamed. I'll be blacklisted at work and put my job in jeopardy.

The again, the US have been shaping the entire world for such a long time, I feel us foreigners have earnt the right to criticize you when it's necessary. Especially as I'm someone who loves the country (well, I consider it to be the land of the best and the land of the worst, as I've told her) and has been closely following the situation (albeit from afar, but internet is a magical place) over the Atlantic for well over a decade.

Anyways, after she told me : ""*Now if you wish to discuss in an adult manner and not disparage my country or my President, I’ll listen and correct then misinformation you’ve been fed by liberal a\*\*clowns! If not... have a good day""*

I replied with : *""As I've said, I love your country, it's the land of the best and the land of the worst for me. I wont diss on the country, truly. Your president on the other hand is one of the worst scumbags our species has to offer. And he shouldnt be above criticism.""*

To which she said : ""*Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.""*

Which at first took me completely by surprise... so there are people out there who genuinely believe there is nothing one can reproach to Trump or criticize him on, that's... I mean... waw.

So, well, that was over half an hour ago and I've spent the last twenty minutes replying to her with all that came to my mind... and there is so much it was hell to begin with. It was interesting to me that the first thing that came to my mind what his telling to the 4 American Congresswomen (three of them were born in the US) to go back to their own country...

And then, after I typed those words, everything else flooded and I had to stop myself at some point. But yeah, that made me realize once more the strategy of that scumbag of a human being : drown every scandal with a bigger one so we dont know where to start with him.

Now... over six hours later, she replied. For my mental health, I dont want to discuss with such a person any further, but I felt like sharing some of the bits she answered me with... and truth be told, I wouldnt even know where to start replying to a person so far up their ass, I dont think it's even worth it... but still, there you go (keep in mind, all my posts were posted in succession six hours ago and she only replied to some now) : 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------

Her : *Give me one example of this atrocious behavior you find so reprehensible please.*

Me : *Just one ? I could go for ages, but at the top of my head: telling four American women (three of them who were born in the US mind you !) to go back to their country.  One more? Saying there are respectable people on both sides when nazis are concerned...* 

Her : *The respectable remark was a lie!  That is NOT what he said.  See, you get all the liberal spin, and the desire to believe everything you hear without research, (sheep).  You’re simply wrong* 

Me : *This could go on for ages... let's talk insulting a crippled reporter at a rally. Or forcing Ivanka's presence at a G7 summit where she had no place at all. Or Judge Curiel's affair... or asking for Obama's birth certificate... or just contradicting himself everytime he talks.* 

Her : *We have a law that you must be a natural born citizen to be POTUS, let me inform you that it was Hillary who brought up he wasn’t born here when she was running against him!* 

Me : *Or the hypocrisy at calling Obama on his golfing practice when he has spent a gazillion more times than him golfing. Again, the list could go for hours. I have a huge respect for America, but that man is an utter disgrace to the humankind. On every aspect.* 

Her :  *I could careless about golfing, except when an American had his head removed from his shoulders and Obama cried for the camera, turned and hit the fairway!* 

Me :  *Or using his position to blackmail assistance to a country in exchange for personal political gain. Or pardoning a war-criminal (Eddie Gallagher). Or the Stormy Daniels incident (I thought conservatives put more values than that on being a family man).* 

Her :  *Stormy Daniels said a few months ago, she lied... it never happened!*   
*You mean Ukraine, but I’m sorry... that’s been debunked.  Only radical lefties used that for impeachment purposes.  Not one word had been mentioned about Ukraine since!* 

Me :  *Oh yeah, I havent even mentioned the ""grab them by the pussy"" part. Or calling Covid a hoax when he had intel reports over two months previously. Or his blatant racism towards tenants back in 1973:*  [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/us/politics/donald-trump-housing-race.html) 

Her :  *The hot mic moment? who cares? There’s not one man of power, and means who hasn’t taken advantage of that fact to get the most beautiful woman whom btw, have been giving it away to the highest bidder for ages!*  
*In 1973? Well damn... did you know the grand wizard of the KKK was friends with Biden and Hillary Clinton’s mentor? Give me a break.  We was barely out of segregation at that time.  Things, times and minds have evolved since then!*   
*The “hoax” mentioned, would you have heard the entire speech was that the democrats bi\*ching about Trump not taking steps early enough was a hoax! He did a China ban while Pelosi was telling people to “come to Chinatown”!* 

***Note : the following exchange was one of the very first one we had, but putting it here cause I think it's less relevant to  the overall conversation.*** 

Me : *As I've said, there's so many things to love about the US, but not only. For me, it's the land of the absolute best and the absolute worst our species has to offer. :)* 

Her : *That could be said about anywhere on the planet you picked. The difference between here and so many other places is we get to choose if we want to be an a\*\* or not! Gotta love freedom* 

Me : *But freedom ends where someone else's freedom begins. Freedom is not absolute. And before you jump on me, I'm French, I've quite verse with what freedom entails. Freedom of speech doesnt protect you from freedom of consequences of your speech for exemple.* 

Her :  *I agree, and with great freedom comes great responsibility and our press has forgot about that and all they want to do is malign, disparage and lie every chance they get and then print a retraction on pg 20 in small print, when they’re caught in the BS.* 

\-----------------------------------------------

So there you go... I'm not gonna waste anymore time debating with someone like that. It's exhausting and I've sadly come to questionning why I've wasted so much energy on a country that is not mine (even though I love it and would really wish to come and become a US citizen at some point, but damn, that is such a hard and discouraging thing to accomplish), but I felt like this convo needed to be shared so as much people as possible can have an insight (even if it's just one person) into how Trump boot-lickers think and see the world.

Have a great day, night or whatever, and keep up the good fight America, you got this and I'm sure you'll get out of it better and stronger.

For decades we have seen unarmed African Americans murdered in the streets by police using excessive force. When does it end? What did we think was going to happen? Over night, violent protests erupted in major cities all over the United States demanding justice be served for the murder of George Floyd. Mass unemployment, racial tensions, and a general lack of faith in the legal system have boiled over and the result has been nothing short of anarchy.

Colorado Civil Background Check Rules are being changed! Colorado Supreme Court is asking for input!,3,g7i4ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g7i4ar/colorado_civil_background_check_rules_are_being/,1,1587796248.0," 

Hi Everyone!

County  Court Civil Rules Committee will be meeting again in June.  The March  meeting was cancelled for obvious reasons.  Please remember, one of the  major points of discussion involve suppressing false accusations being  made in Civil Court to bypass criminal rules and procedures.

Basically what's been going on in Colorado is an influx of people like Landlords, Collections Agencies and Family/Neighbors filing revenge claims in Civil Court with Criminal Accusations attached to harass or extort their target.  Colorado Supreme Court has been discussing it since last September (you can find the minutes of their meetings in the link below) and are getting ready to change how Civil Checks work.  This is a big deal and they are asking people for their input.

I do not believe this is a conservative or liberal issue, I believe it is an everybody issue.

I  am asking all of you to write a letter requesting swift action to the  rules change that will allow an accused person to suppress dismissed  allegations.  For those who don't know what's going on in Colorado,  here's a basic summary:

Landlords,  Collections Agencies, Neighbors, Family and Co Workers are using civil  laws designed to protect victims to file false claims of criminal acts  while bypassing the criminal justice system (this includes Protection  Orders and other Red Flag type laws).  They can then drop the  accusations before an evidentiary hearing to prevent the accused from  providing proof of innocence, it also allows the accuser to make a  verbal accusation without evidence of wrongdoing.The Judge then vacates  but without prejudice, allowing the accused to bring the accusation up  again if a new event happens.  This legitimizes the first accusation,  even if no evidence was provided, despite sections of the law that  prohibit an accusation from being used as evidence of  wrongdoing.Collections Agencies are even more suited to abusing the law,  because all they have to do is claim they were threatened when  presenting the accused with a demand.  They can directly then garnish  the wages.  We now have a law against surprise billing, but it still  doesn't help those who have been falsely accused of a violent act in  court by Collections Agencies.

The  Colorado Civil Rules committee can be found here, along with a link to  minutes of their meetings.  I believe they first started discussing the  issues at play in September.  


(Apparently I can't post a link right now I have to post the thread first)  


So what is their solution?  Their solution is to officially add District Court Rules 121 p 1-5 to the County Court System.  This is a decent solution but there are holes to this.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you support this, which is cool, LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU SUPPORT!

I am personally advocating for an AUTOMATED PROCESS.

The benefits of an automated process over a Judicial Discretionary Process are:

1. Less stress on the court system.
2. Significantly  reduced legal fees.  Since minorities and the  impoverished are  directly affected by this, reduced legal fees are a  major point.
3. County  Court Judges have already expressed a desire to err on the  side of  caution far too much, so much so it's created the problem we are  facing  today.
4. More  expedient.  The current Rule 121 p 1-5 system requires a  judge to  weigh the pros and cons, and it can take weeks or months before  an  answer is received.
5. Out  of state people who have been maliciously targeted will need  an  automated system to alleviate the extreme burden of a prolonged  hearing  process.

The automated process would require these things:

1. An independent investigation by a 3rd party proving there is no evidence of wrongdoing
2. The accusation is dropped or dismissed
3. support of the original petitioner to be considered in place of one or both of the above two

If  those conditions are met then the accusation is sealed.  If there  was  no wrong doing, then it is expunged after the statute of limitations   for the original accusation is up.

IN  EITHER CASE, I FULLY support ANY rule change the CRC chooses to make.   If they stick with expanding District Court Rule 121 p 1-5, then we  should still support it because it's better than nothing.  PLEASE  contact them and give your support for an expedient decision!

Written/mailed  letters (not email, letters) are more beneficial than  phone calls.  I  don't even think they accept emails.  Justice Richard  Gabriel is in  charge of the Civil Rules Committee.  Please be  respectful, not  demanding.",Progressive,0

"Our medical workers are on the ""Front Line,"" why don't we treat our medical professionals like the soldiers they are?",4,g5qb6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g5qb6l/our_medical_workers_are_on_the_front_line_why/,0,1587540835.0,"OK, so this might be the wrong place for it, but I've been thinking a lot about our broken healthcare system (US) and our response to COVID. I'm hearing various media outlets say that our medical professionals are on the ""front lines"" of the virus outbreak, and i think this is a very apt metaphor; front lines generally used to describe the battlefront in war. I began to extrapolate it further, and started thinking of what it would look like if we trained Doctors like soldiers.

One of the things i think our military does very well is the education for service trade off. I almost took advantage of it myself 12 years ago, but then i met my wife and I didn't want to leave her to join the military. My plan was to get a degree through the military and then serve as repayment, like many of our service members, I felt like this was a better choice than student loans. 

We hear all the time that our medical professionals have incredible student loan debt, and we also hear we don't have enough doctors and nurses... What I've dreamt up is essentially a branch of the military for healthcare. Enlist in the service, get your medical training, and then serve as a doctor for the government for a period of time. These people would be deployed, the same way our soldiers are deployed. Maybe that means in a podunk town in Arkansas (shout out to my family in Japton) or maybe you're in NY or LA... who knows. You'd be put up in government housing during your time serving, something akin to barracks, and would be paid a salary far below what a doctor normally makes, but enough cover basic living expenses, but in exchange you got your medical training debt free. 

Personally, i'm a proponent of a single payer healthcare system, but i also don't feel like that is going to happen in the US without serious push back; if i'm being pragmatic and honest with myself, I think a public option will probably be what actually happens. This military like medical service could support the public option. This would also open up the lucrative field of becoming a medical professional to those who may be economically disadvantaged. The kicker would be that you aren't guaranteed to become a doctor unless you can perform in the school and in rotations. You might leave with a ton of experience and the ability to work in healthcare, but maybe not a medical license to become a PCP or a medical doctor in a hospital; there still needs to be some sort of performance requirement and evaluation to make sure you can cut it in this high stakes position, but this would be a possible path to get there without expensive student loans. This would also incentivize a very cost effective and streamlined federal medical school, and outline federal medical education standard.

The bonus is the added flexibility. Right now, we have locations with shortages of doctors and nurses, and other locations that aren't hit as hard. Since these medical servicemen and women are tasked by the government, they could be redeployed to virus hot spots. Hell, even a war zone if shit really hits the fan.

The other bonus I see is better staffing for the VA with doctors who are serving out their time paying off uncle sam. 

Additionally, this could drive down the expense of doctors in two ways; 1) more doctors would be able to get their medical license cheaper than they are today, and wont be paying off student loans until they're 50, but 2) a massive supply and demand shift as we have a larger supply of doctors and medical professionals in the country. 

Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of problems with this idea, I'd love to hear why you hate it or why you like it. I'm also probably the least qualified person because i'm not a doctor. I'm remotely tied with the healthcare industry, but as a webdeveloper; i've never gone to medical school. So I'm not married to it, i wont be offended if you call me a fucking moron, but i'm also just looking for opinions on this. I doubt i'm the only one who has thought of this; maybe you know of some politicians advocating something like this? I dunno. Just tell me what you think.",Progressive,0

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

Show Us Your Ethics,4,j5huzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/j5huzi/show_us_your_ethics/,1,1601926903.0,"I'm so disgusted with this constant beat down of the 99% by the 1%. Yes, not an original thought by far. The latest to get my blood boiling is the announcement by several major airlines that they plan to start furloughing workers. I'm not a Finance whiz but am I missing something here? Just scanning through publicly available information:

[Average & Median AA Salaries are](https://www.comparably.com/companies/american-airlines/salaries)= $128k/$117k. [Number of Estimated American Airline Announces Imminent Furloughs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/american-airlines-says-it-will-begin-furlough-of-19000-employees-as-hope-for-federal-help-fades/2020/09/30/6e632240-0340-11eb-a2db-417cddf4816a_story.html) = 19,000 workers for 3 to 6 months = 119k* $117k * .25 (or .5) = $555.75 million (3 months) to $1.1 billion (6 months)

Ok, yes that's a lot. I can see how important it is to cut costs at a time when the airline has seen such a drastic decrease from an average share price in the $30's in March to about $10.7 in April 2020. I can only imagine that it has been barely making ends meet what with its stock price continuing to plummet, top executives foregoing pay to keep people employed because they've received no assistance from the federal government. 

Except No:

[Average AA Share Price April 1, 2020 and October 1, 2020 ](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAL/american-airlines-group/stock-price-history) = $10.69/share and $12.58/share

[2019 Total Compensation of Top Five AA Execs](https://www1.salary.com/AMERICAN-AIRLINES-GROUP-INC-Executive-Salaries.html) = $30.9 million

[Stimulus Checks to AA in April 2020](https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-To-Receive-58-Billion-in-Payroll-Support-From-US-Department-of-the-Treasury-OPS-DIS-04/) = $4.8 billion

If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts.

He supports Trump and says he is voting to re-elect the president because “He has kept all of his promises,” and “he’s bringing jobs and God back to America.”

My Dad has always shown respect for women and minorities, but he doesn’t mind that Trump is openly opposite in those areas.

The way the voting system works ensures the existence of massive, monolithic parties that everyone has to settle for. Ranked choice voting would make it so smaller parties could actually win elections and grow support. In early 2020, I didn't see any candidates (besides Yang) push for RCV on their platform.

Did Georgette Gomez flipflop on our Progressive Values to get early Progressive support?,5,ihatz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/ihatz0/did_georgette_gomez_flipflop_on_our_progressive/,2,1598516408.0,"I was a Bernie Delegate and resident of CA-53 that Georgette Gomez is running for congress. I was surprised to see that so many Progressive organizations endorsed this Gomez because she never was clear on Medicare for all, did not endorse Bernie, supports Isreal 100%, and gave our local police department here in San Diego a $25 million dollar budget increase.

There was latter put out by the Bernie Delegates ([https://forms.gle/gjgWf7UNg3BmXLHM7](https://forms.gle/gjgWf7UNg3BmXLHM7)) that no organization has answered, and Gomez just put out her policy platform [https://georgettegomez.org/georgettes-bold-plan-for-america/](https://georgettegomez.org/georgettes-bold-plan-for-america/). That says quote ""it’s time to boldly reconstruct our healthcare system so it is affordable, accessible and universal.  We must move swiftly to extend open enrollment periods for the Affordable Care Act and move toward  making a Medicare for All public option available to bring down costs and protect coverage for families and small businesses.""

Gomez is doing an AMA tomorrow at 10 AM PDT I think we should ask her what she means.

We need to get this info to the Progressive Organizations that GG is not who she says she is.

Feel free to comment any criticism! I'm always trying to get better.

* The video is titled “How to End White Privilege,” so I’m sure that’s what he’ll discuss
   * ...oh
* Hello, token black conservative!
* Immediately, he misunderstands the purpose of acknowledging white privilege
   * It’s not to feel good or virtue signal
   * It’s to better inform current and future policy
   * We don’t acknowledge gravity because it makes us feel better, we acknowledge it because
      * A) Doing so helps us understand and explain reality better
      * B) It helps us build better systems
   * We acknowledge white privilege because it helps us understand current racial divisions in the US and allows us to more effectively work towards remedying such issues
* He uses a lackluster definition: ""because you’re born with white skin, you have all these advantages I don’t have.""
   * By viewing a statistical/systemic issue from an anecdotal/individualistic approach, you’ve very effectively strawmanned the argument.
   * Wikipedia actually does a really good job at defining it: “White privilege is the societal privilege that benefits white people over non-white people in some societies, particularly if they are otherwise under the same social, political, or economic circumstances.”
   * Wonder why they left that second piece out??
* Like what?
   * It’s interesting that he doesn’t touch on two of the most important issues facing black people
      * Unfair sentencing
      * Over policing
* “I got the house”

   * OP, I hear you say, causation does not equal correlation. Maybe all of that comes down to wealth inequality, not race.
      * We know that
      * This means that if loan discrimination happened at some point in the (fairly recent) past, we would still be feeling the effect of it and it could largely account for this current disparity
* Which brings us to Redlining :(
   * “I’ve never heard of such a banker”
      * [Well, on the loan side, you have redlining, it all started when the Federal Housing Administration refused to insure mortgages in/near black neighborhoods. ](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america)

   * Just wanted to point out that this argument can be used to justify racial profiling, which would perpetuate racial crime disparities
      * Here’s how:
* “Blacks have more privilege than whites”
   * I’m interested to see where this goes. Maybe he’ll talk about college or something?
      * “It’s been my experience”
      * [Oh… so no real argument.](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/anecdotal)
   * Notice how PragerU sometimes doesn’t use real data for their figures/visuals/graphs
      * It’s almost like they dont’t have any data to support some of the claims they make
* “If two people are equally qualified for a job, the black person will usually get it.”

   * Also, he acts like normalizing white skin color as skin color doesn’t demean black people by treating white skin as default and accepted.
* “Today, these so called progressives dominate our colleges and universities.”
   * I wonder why progressivism dominates educated circles lol
* He just spends the next couple minutes misunderstanding the point of white privilege again.
* “How could this not create a victim mentality?”
   * I dunno, maybe if we fixed it instead of letting it fester
   * Also, are you saying we shouldn’t tell uncomfortable, studied truths?
      * Isn’t Conservatism all about uncomfortable truths? They don't call it the intellectual socially acceptable web.
* How come he accepts the existence of two-parent family privilege, American privilege, and good gene privilege yet fails to accept white privilege due to a counterpoint that applies equally to all of the above privileges?
   * He argues: Doesn’t **white privilege** depend on the person? If a **black lawyer and his wife** have a baby and a **meth addict, single white woman** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **white** one? Because he’s **white**? Cmon now!
   * Using his logic, you could say: Doesn’t **two-parent family privilege** depend on the person? If a **single lawyer mother** has a baby and a **meth addict, abusive couple** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with two parents**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **American privilege** depend on the person? If a **lawyer English couple** has a baby and a **meth addict, single American** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **American**? Because he’s **American**? Cmon now!
      * or: Doesn’t **good gene privilege** depend on the person? If a **doctor couple who understand how to control heart issues but have genes with a higher risk of heart disease** have a baby and a **meth addict, single mother** has a baby, which kid has privilege? The **one with better genes**? Because he’s **less likely to have heart issues**? Cmon now!
   * This is because all four examples are equally a privilege, but he tries to completely change the implication of privilege for white privilege:
      * Having a single privilege does not guarantee an easy life (there are way too many other factors), but it does mean that that one aspect of your life isn’t going to be what makes it harder for you than others.
* In the end, this video boils down to a few issues: a lack of understanding of why we identify white privilege, a lack of evidence for or against arguments, and a misunderstanding of what privilege even does.

Edit: PragerU does have sources on their [site](https://www.prageru.com/video/how-to-end-white-privilege/), but literally none of them are to back up quantitative claims, just qualitative opinions and one historical fact (the list of white privilege origins). It's a jumble of broken links, insanely partisan sources, appeals to authority, and (of course) none of them are peer reviewed. This source list is the epitome of feels over reals.",Progressive,0

Obviously, as I noted, I am looking for realistic responses; which importantly noted that the VP is almost guaranteed to be a female and probably another marginalized identity (LGBT, POC, etc.)as well (cause identity politics, yay). Don’t get me wrong, I am all for those things I just think this supposed pledge by Biden is pandering and that’s it, but anywho...

So, for me I’ve been trying to go through all the realistic potential picks and it seems like the top 3 most progressive are Abrams, Warren and Baldwin. However, with Warren I feel like she kind of lost a lot of her progressive credibility due to her actions during the primaries.

Then, sending in armed professionals

Then, declaring a curfew (as early as 1pm) to label them all as rule-breakers, which justifies their actions to some.

Then, pepper spraying crowds BEFORE their arbitrary curfews even start

Then, shooting people while claiming they're returning fire (reports have been disputed by the protestors)

Then, labeling all protestors as antifa rioters

Then, arresting as many as they can

We're no longer allowed to dissent.

Even me typing this could potentially get me arrested.

If this post does wind up in a courtroom, I encourage the jury to re-read the first amendment.

The news outlets haven't touched this subject.

America should be rebelling, in non-violent protest, against these unconstitutional changes.

But now all non-violent protests are labelled antifa riots.

I'm anti-fascism. Are you for it?

We should be demanding the president be impeached.

If you're for these tactics, you are unamerican, unconstitutional, and are helping lose what this country stands for.

Over night, violent protests erupted in major cities all over the United States demanding justice be served for the murder of George Floyd. Mass unemployment, racial tensions, and a general lack of faith in the legal system have boiled over and the result has been nothing short of anarchy.

Colorado Civil Background Check Rules are being changed! Colorado Supreme Court is asking for input!,5,g7i4ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g7i4ar/colorado_civil_background_check_rules_are_being/,1,1587796248.0," 

Hi Everyone!

County  Court Civil Rules Committee will be meeting again in June.  The March  meeting was cancelled for obvious reasons.  Please remember, one of the  major points of discussion involve suppressing false accusations being  made in Civil Court to bypass criminal rules and procedures.

Basically what's been going on in Colorado is an influx of people like Landlords, Collections Agencies and Family/Neighbors filing revenge claims in Civil Court with Criminal Accusations attached to harass or extort their target.  Colorado Supreme Court has been discussing it since last September (you can find the minutes of their meetings in the link below) and are getting ready to change how Civil Checks work.  This is a big deal and they are asking people for their input.

I do not believe this is a conservative or liberal issue, I believe it is an everybody issue.

I  am asking all of you to write a letter requesting swift action to the  rules change that will allow an accused person to suppress dismissed  allegations.  For those who don't know what's going on in Colorado,  here's a basic summary:

Landlords,  Collections Agencies, Neighbors, Family and Co Workers are using civil  laws designed to protect victims to file false claims of criminal acts  while bypassing the criminal justice system (this includes Protection  Orders and other Red Flag type laws).  They can then drop the  accusations before an evidentiary hearing to prevent the accused from  providing proof of innocence, it also allows the accuser to make a  verbal accusation without evidence of wrongdoing.The Judge then vacates  but without prejudice, allowing the accused to bring the accusation up  again if a new event happens.  This legitimizes the first accusation,  even if no evidence was provided, despite sections of the law that  prohibit an accusation from being used as evidence of  wrongdoing.Collections Agencies are even more suited to abusing the law,  because all they have to do is claim they were threatened when  presenting the accused with a demand.  They can directly then garnish  the wages.  We now have a law against surprise billing, but it still  doesn't help those who have been falsely accused of a violent act in  court by Collections Agencies.

The  Colorado Civil Rules committee can be found here, along with a link to  minutes of their meetings.  I believe they first started discussing the  issues at play in September.  


(Apparently I can't post a link right now I have to post the thread first)  


So what is their solution?  Their solution is to officially add District Court Rules 121 p 1-5 to the County Court System.  This is a decent solution but there are holes to this.  Maybe I'm wrong, maybe you support this, which is cool, LET THEM KNOW WHAT YOU SUPPORT!

I am personally advocating for an AUTOMATED PROCESS.

The benefits of an automated process over a Judicial Discretionary Process are:

1. Less stress on the court system.
2. Significantly  reduced legal fees.  Since minorities and the  impoverished are  directly affected by this, reduced legal fees are a  major point.
3. County  Court Judges have already expressed a desire to err on the  side of  caution far too much, so much so it's created the problem we are  facing  today.
4. More  expedient.  The current Rule 121 p 1-5 system requires a  judge to  weigh the pros and cons, and it can take weeks or months before  an  answer is received.
5. Out  of state people who have been maliciously targeted will need  an  automated system to alleviate the extreme burden of a prolonged  hearing  process.

The automated process would require these things:

1. An independent investigation by a 3rd party proving there is no evidence of wrongdoing
2. The accusation is dropped or dismissed
3. support of the original petitioner to be considered in place of one or both of the above two

If  those conditions are met then the accusation is sealed.  If there  was  no wrong doing, then it is expunged after the statute of limitations   for the original accusation is up.

IN  EITHER CASE, I FULLY support ANY rule change the CRC chooses to make.   If they stick with expanding District Court Rule 121 p 1-5, then we  should still support it because it's better than nothing.  PLEASE  contact them and give your support for an expedient decision!

Written/mailed  letters (not email, letters) are more beneficial than  phone calls.  I  don't even think they accept emails.  Justice Richard  Gabriel is in  charge of the Civil Rules Committee.  Please be  respectful, not  demanding.",Progressive,0

"Our medical workers are on the ""Front Line,"" why don't we treat our medical professionals like the soldiers they are?",2,g5qb6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/g5qb6l/our_medical_workers_are_on_the_front_line_why/,0,1587540835.0,"OK, so this might be the wrong place for it, but I've been thinking a lot about our broken healthcare system (US) and our response to COVID. I'm hearing various media outlets say that our medical professionals are on the ""front lines"" of the virus outbreak, and i think this is a very apt metaphor; front lines generally used to describe the battlefront in war. I began to extrapolate it further, and started thinking of what it would look like if we trained Doctors like soldiers.

One of the things i think our military does very well is the education for service trade off. I almost took advantage of it myself 12 years ago, but then i met my wife and I didn't want to leave her to join the military. My plan was to get a degree through the military and then serve as repayment, like many of our service members, I felt like this was a better choice than student loans. 

We hear all the time that our medical professionals have incredible student loan debt, and we also hear we don't have enough doctors and nurses... What I've dreamt up is essentially a branch of the military for healthcare. Enlist in the service, get your medical training, and then serve as a doctor for the government for a period of time. These people would be deployed, the same way our soldiers are deployed. Maybe that means in a podunk town in Arkansas (shout out to my family in Japton) or maybe you're in NY or LA... who knows. You'd be put up in government housing during your time serving, something akin to barracks, and would be paid a salary far below what a doctor normally makes, but enough cover basic living expenses, but in exchange you got your medical training debt free. 

Personally, i'm a proponent of a single payer healthcare system, but i also don't feel like that is going to happen in the US without serious push back; if i'm being pragmatic and honest with myself, I think a public option will probably be what actually happens. This military like medical service could support the public option. This would also open up the lucrative field of becoming a medical professional to those who may be economically disadvantaged. The kicker would be that you aren't guaranteed to become a doctor unless you can perform in the school and in rotations. You might leave with a ton of experience and the ability to work in healthcare, but maybe not a medical license to become a PCP or a medical doctor in a hospital; there still needs to be some sort of performance requirement and evaluation to make sure you can cut it in this high stakes position, but this would be a possible path to get there without expensive student loans. This would also incentivize a very cost effective and streamlined federal medical school, and outline federal medical education standard.

The bonus is the added flexibility. Right now, we have locations with shortages of doctors and nurses, and other locations that aren't hit as hard. Since these medical servicemen and women are tasked by the government, they could be redeployed to virus hot spots. Hell, even a war zone if shit really hits the fan.

The other bonus I see is better staffing for the VA with doctors who are serving out their time paying off uncle sam. 

Additionally, this could drive down the expense of doctors in two ways; 1) more doctors would be able to get their medical license cheaper than they are today, and wont be paying off student loans until they're 50, but 2) a massive supply and demand shift as we have a larger supply of doctors and medical professionals in the country. 

Anyway, I'm sure there are plenty of problems with this idea, I'd love to hear why you hate it or why you like it. I'm also probably the least qualified person because i'm not a doctor. I'm remotely tied with the healthcare industry, but as a webdeveloper; i've never gone to medical school. So I'm not married to it, i wont be offended if you call me a fucking moron, but i'm also just looking for opinions on this. I doubt i'm the only one who has thought of this; maybe you know of some politicians advocating something like this? I dunno. Just tell me what you think.",Progressive,0

&#x200B;

Planet Earth has a finite ecological base with finite exploitable resources.  Our world economic systen requires open-ended economic growth to maintain it's existance. The creation of financial instruments to fund the exploitation of non-renewable resources is tantamount to comiting economic suicide. The analogy is an alcoholic saying that he feels good and that nothing bad will happen to him.  Some conomists give humanity 10 years to migrate to a sustainable economy, after which econmic hardship will exponentially expand for humanity.  See [https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/](https://earth.org/climate-crisis-could-collapse-the-global-economy/).  

&#x200B;

The United States, which should be a leader in helping to bring about about an more sustainable economic system based on renewable sources of energy and renewable resources has instead ""walked the paper backward"" over the last 4 years.  Regime change is in the wind. Curren polls indicate a hopeful oucome.  See [https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls](https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/presidential-polls), but let us take nothing for granted.

&#x200B;

There is a window of opportunity remaining, and you can still make a difference.

Important PSA: Do not treat tear gas or pepper sprays with the following items,8,iuhl62,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/iuhl62/important_psa_do_not_treat_tear_gas_or_pepper/,0,1600370865.0,"*This is taken from the book Riot Medicine, if you have any scientific data to contradict the information presented. I will add it.*

Note: RCA means Riot Control Agent, which is the technical term for things like tear gas and pepper spray.

* **LAW/Maalox:**   Liquid antacid and water (LAW) is a mixture of 50% liquid antacid and 50% water. In some countries, LAW is simply referred to as Maalox \[the name of a popular brand of liquid antacid.\] LAW is an extremely popular treatment, in part because of its simplicity and the minor cooling sensation patients report when LAW is applied to the skin. Liquid antacid does not belong in the eyes, and although rare, ingredients in antacids may cause an allergic reaction. Research on  pain relief provided by topical application of antacid is mixed. One study showed no significant decrease in pain for patients exposed to OC spray after applying liquid antacid. Another showed statistically significant decrease in pain up to the 60 minute mark, but Riot Control Agent   Contamination concluded “the difference in \[pain levels\] may have questionable clinical significance.” Anecdotal evidence supports the idea that LAW decreases pain for OC spray on the skin, but it is not recommended even if it is marginally more effective.
* **Baby Shampoo:**   Baby shampoo has not been shown to be effective when used in the eyes or on the skin for treating either pepper spray or tear gas.
* **FAST:** Fixative antacid surfactant treatment (FAST) is a pepper spray remedy originally published on It’s Going Down. FAST was de-signed to be a more effective alternative to LAW that combined the active ingredients of antacid, sunflower lecithin, and baby shampoo. While there was some   experimentation done by the creators to determine whether this treatment was effective, it lacked the rigor be make conclusions. More generally, research on the individual active ingredients suggests that they do not  provide a statistically significant decrease in pain.
* **Cow's Milk:** Plain cow’s milk is another common treatment for pepper spray and tear gas. Pouring milk into the eyes has risk of infection, and this is especially true on hot days where the milk will not remain refrigerated before use. The stickiness and stench of milk is another downside of using milk as a decontaminant. Most importantly, cow’s milk used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been show to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Oils:** Mineral oil followed immediately by alcohol (MOFIBA) is an outdated treatment for pepper spray contamination that is no longer used by most medics. The treatment worked by covering small patches of skin with mineral oil to attract pepper spray, then removing it with rubbing   alcohol. This was retired from use because if done incorrectly can cause additional pain over pepper spray alone. Similarly, people have used vegetable oil to wash the affected area, wiping the residue off after, and this should not be done either. Both of these methods are harmful because oil will trap the RCA against the skin.
* **Onions:** Onions have been inaccurately reported as effective against tear gas. This belief seems to be most prevalent in the Middle East and North Africa. The reported procedure is to breath over whole or cut onions, and in particular to use onions themselves as part of improvised gas masks to mitigate the effects of inhaling tear gas. RCAs, and in particular tear gas, are lachrymators.  Chopped onion releases a chemical which is also a lachrymator. Onions do not mitigate or prevent   the effects of tear gas.
* **Vinegar:** Vinegar is another commonly suggested ineffective remedy and preventative measure for tear gas inhalation. Activists suggest using it as a decontaminant on affected skin. It has been suggested to soak a bandana in vinegar then breath through it to prevent inhalation of tear gas.  Like tear gas, vinegar is a lachrymator. Vinegar vapor irritates the eyes, and prolonged inhalation will irritate the lungs.
* **Citrus:** Lemon and lime have been suggested to be used like vinegar, both as a decontaminant wash for the skin and with a bandana as a filter for tear gas. There is no evidence either of these have any effect on reducing the irritation associated with tear gas or preventing inhalation.
* **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Hydrogen peroxide is another remedy used by activists and medics to treat tear gas and pepper spray. There is no evidence that this has any effect on either, and further, it will cause additional burning sensations if it gets into the eyes or other mucous membranes. Given   that pepper spray is mainly aimed at the face and tear gas affects the eyes, nose, and mouth, there is high risk of causing additional harm to the patient even if it was an effective treatment.
* **Lidocaine:** Lidocaine in particular when used as a treatment for pepper spray has not been shown to have a significant effect on pain levels.
* **Miscellaneous:** Some activists have suggested a variety of treatments such as using baking soda paste, topical analgesics, or toothpaste to treat affected areas. These are not recommended as they trap RCAs against the skin and may worsen its effects.

I would strongly suggest you read Riot Medicine's section on RCAs to help  deal with protection and treatment. But I'll provide a summary.

**Protection**

Typically protesters will use goggles and a half-mask respirator or disposable respirator. If these are not available, a hat, glasses, and bandana will still offer a moderate amount of protection. A wet bandana made of a fabric with a tight weave held over the mouth will filter a modest mount of tear gas from the air.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that slow, shallow breaths helps minimize the effects of tear gas on the lungs. Patients have reported feeling the immediate urge to vomit after taking deep breaths in the presence of tear gas and that the feeling persisted until they were able to spend significant time breathing fresh air.

**Treatment**

In general, use water or saline (Manufactured salt water used for medical purposes)

* If you're helping others, introduce yourself first and obtain consent to help, if they are unable to give consent. Do not force treatment onto people. If someone is unconscious you can assume consent, but you have bigger problems to deal with than RCAs.
* Remove yourself/the patient from the area the gas or spray is to an area with fresh air to prevent further damage.
* Do not touch the affected areas.
* Allow tear and mucus production, and allow coughing and sneezing. If you or the patient is asthmatic, use an inhaler.
* Remove and clean contact lenses, possibly dispose of them.
* Decontamination: If it's CR, attempt to brush and dust off as much as possible. Avoid use of water or other liquids to decontaminate the patient unless they are already wet or sweaty, or the RCA is in their eyes (which are  already wet). If not, flush the body part with large amounts of water. For parts of the body other than the eyes, spraying large amounts of water on the affected body part is sufficient.
* Rinse the mouth. Even in the absence of burning or irritating sensations in the mouth, it still helps.

A better pro-abortion argument,5,icl7r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/icl7r8/a_better_proabortion_argument/,20,1597862184.0,"Many people make this single argument when talking about abortion: 'Her body, her choice!' Although this is correct, an anti-abortion person would view this as very selfish.

*A better argument:* Abortion should be legal to make sure no child grows up as unwanted. Most people who are aborting are doing so because they know they will not be able to raise this baby, if they are not able to get rid of it, it will not be raised well. This is not fair for the baby similar to how it is not fair for a terminally ill to not have access to [euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia). A society would rather have several abortions than several parents and children in poverty because they were not able to abort. This argument applies even more to the USA as the cost of childbirth and care is enormous here with very little government support.

Also since this is a safe place to debate abortion, let me bust this common anti-abortion argument: BUt tHeN wHy kIlLing pregnant woMen counts as doUble mUrdEr? It's because we assume the child will not be aborted dummy, most pregnancies end with childbirth. A woman does not tell her intentions to abort to her murderer.",Progressive,0
