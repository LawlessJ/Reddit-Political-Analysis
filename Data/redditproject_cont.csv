—Barack Obama, 2009 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY-7fZ-RX3A))

# TL;DR:


1. The Postal Service processes almost half a billion pieces of mail each day. The anticipated volume of mail-in ballots amount to a fraction of the total volume USPS will deal with over the next two months.
2. The Postal Service has longstanding financial difficulties, but has enough cash on hand to continue operations until October 2021 at current rates, even without tapping a $10 billion line of credit provided by the CARES Act.
3. The Postal Service has been removing under-performing blue mailboxes for decades in response to declining use, including more than 14,000 removed under the Obama Administration. 
4. The Postal Service has been consolidating processing centers and re-orienting operations within processing centers for years in response to declining letter mail volume and increasing package volume.
5. FedEx and other parcel delivery services are also suffering delivery delays amid the coronavirus pandemic. Delays are not unique to USPS.
6. Much has been made of the Postal Service's letter to states encouraging them to send ballots to voters 14 days before Election Day. However, identical recommendations were sent even before DeJoy took over as Postmaster General. Further, the co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections (a Democrat) made the same recommendation.

# Will the Postal Service be able to handle all of the mailed-in ballots this November?


First, let's set some context: the Postal Service [processes](https://facts.usps.com/one-day/#:~:text=The%20Postal%20Service%20processes%20and%20delivers%20472.1%20million%20mail%20pieces%20each%20day) 472 million pieces of mail each day. In the 2016 presidential election, 138 million people voted. [According](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/politics/absentee-voting-analysis/index.html) to CNN, voters will begin receiving absentee ballots as early as September 4. This means that even if every single voter mailed their ballot in over the course of those two months, it would amount to a drop in the ocean compared to the total amount of mail USPS will process during that period.

# Is the Postal Service being underfunded to sabotage the election?


Obviously, the Postal Service has significant [longstanding](https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/) financial difficulties dating back decades, largely due to Congressional mismanagement. The immediate question is, however, is the Postal Service being sabotaged or otherwise undermined to affect the election. In a word: no.

The Postal Service has **more cash on hand than it had before the pandemic**, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/) to the Washington Post:

>At the start of the pandemic, the Postal Service had $9.2 billion in cash, roughly two months of pay for its 630,000 workers. It now has $13.4 billion in cash after tapping a separate $3.4 billion loan from Treasury.

In fact, this is more cash on hand than the USPS has ever had.

In addition, the CARES Act, which Trump signed into law earlier this year, [provides](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0729-treasury-agreement-statement.htm) an **additional $10 billion line of credit** to the USPS, should it need it:

>United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced today that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of the Treasury on the terms and conditions associated with $10 billion lending authority provided in the CARES Act.  The USPS Board of Governors unanimously approved the agreement in principle yesterday and expects that the parties will formally memorialize the agreement through loan documents that will be jointly developed over the coming weeks.

Further, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/) to the Washington Post, the pandemic has actually improved the finances of the Postal Service, not deteriorated them, due to increased e-commerce shipping:

>A tidal wave of packages is keeping the U.S. Postal Service afloat during the coronavirus recession, boosting the beleaguered agency’s finances to near pre-pandemic levels...  


>Week to week, package deliveries increased 20 to 50 percent in April compared with the year-ago period, and 60 to 80 percent in May.

As a result, **the Postal Service has enough money to continue operations well past the election, through March 2021 at the worst and October 2021 at the best, without even accessing the Treasury's $10 billion line of credit**:

>If package volumes persist at 15 to 20 percent above normal levels in the coming months and the Postal Service does not do any more borrowing, it will delay its solvency crisis until October 2021. But if package volumes return to pre-pandemic levels, the agency is set to run out of cash by March. Accessing the $10 billion loan from Treasury would put off insolvency even further.

In short, there is no imminent danger that the Postal Service will run out of money prior to the election.

# What about them taking away the blue mailboxes?


The Washington Post [covered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/07/24/ST2009072403875.html?sid=ST2009072403875) the declining use of public mailboxes in **2009**:

>...half of the blue boxes in the Washington area have disappeared in the last nine years, and 200,000 nationwide have been plucked up in the last 20 years, leaving 175,000 total.  


>The U.S. Postal Service says it removes ""underperforming"" mailboxes -- those that collect fewer than 25 pieces of mail a day -- after a week-long ""density test."" Snail mail is a dying enterprise because Americans increasingly pay bills online, send Evites for parties and text or give a quick call on a cellphone rather than write a letter.

In addition, the Obama-appointed USPS Inspector General [noted](https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/mail-collection-box-%E2%80%94-management-service-status) in **2016** that this process continued under the Obama Administration and is based on usage data:

>Nationwide, there were about 153,000 collection boxes at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2016; however, the U.S. Postal Service has been removing underused boxes, with about 14,000 boxes removed over the past five years. Postal Service policy requires approval by the Area and public notification in order to permanently remove a collection box.

Separately, since **2016**, USPS has been [removing](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/local/2019/04/04/u-s-postal-service-installing-new-mailboxes-combat-mail-fishing/3346179002/) older model blue mailboxes and replacing them with new ones that prevent mail fishing (where a perpetrator steals mail from the box):

>Since late 2016, the U.S. Postal Service has been replacing or retrofitting thousands of mailboxes throughout the Northeast to combat a surge in mail theft involving string and glue contraptions.  


>“As the deployment progresses, northern New Jersey consumers will notice a difference with the way mail is deposited into the security enhanced boxes,” said George Flood, a Postal Service spokesman. “The new collection boxes demonstrate our commitment to the safety and security of the mail.”

In short, USPS has been removing or replacing blue mailboxes for over a decade because *nobody uses them anymore* or they need to be replaced with more secure ones. It's not a conspiracy. It's standard practice based on usage and theft data.

# What about them removing mail sorting machines and closing processing centers?


As the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/politics/postal-service-to-consolidate-48-processing-centers-in-coming-months.html) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/postal-service-set-to-announce-facility-closures/2012/02/22/gIQApEluTR_blog.html) reported, the Postal Service has been consolidating processing centers since at least **2012**, moving to centralized processing as a way to drive efficiencies in response to declining mail volume:

>The United States Postal Service announced Thursday \[February 23, 2012\] that it would begin consolidating 48 mail processing centers beginning in July, the first phase of a cost-cutting plan that is intended to save the agency nearly $1.2 billion a year as it tries to adjust to declining mail volume.

Likewise, as total volume of mail continues to shift toward packages and away from letter mail, the Postal Service has been re-orienting existing processing centers toward package processing. After publishing an almost conspiratorial article about a mere 19 mail sorting machines being removed from five processing centers, Vice [edited](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election) its article to append this more plausible explanation:

>Most of the machines being dismantled in the facilities Motherboard identified are delivery bar code sorters (DBCS), into which letters, postcards and similarly sized mail (but not magazines and large envelopes, which are categorized as “flats” and sorted differently) are fed.  


>After publication, USPS spokesperson David Partenheimer told Motherboard, “The Postal Service routinely moves equipment around its network as necessary to match changing mail and package volumes. Package volume is up, but mail volume continues to decline. Adapting our processing infrastructure to the current volumes will ensure more efficient, cost effective operations and better service for our customers.”  


>Marketing mail is down more than 15 percent through June of this year compared to last year. While this is a much steeper drop than recent years, it is **continuing a decade-long trend of mail volume decline for everything but packages. In other words, DBCSs have less mail to sort than they ever have before and it’s far from clear how much of that mail is ever coming back. So it stands to reason the USPS might not need as many of them.**  


>The postal workers interviewed by Motherboard understood this, and in some cases even made the argument some DBCS machines might be of better use at other facilities.

In fact, just because a mail sorting machine is removed from one processing center doesn't mean it wont be used elsewhere, as even CNN [admitted](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/usps-documents-sorting-machine-removal-order/index.html):

>CNN has previously reported that union officials had said the destination of each removed machine varies. Some are scrapped entirely while some are transferred to other facilities.

[According](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/mail-sorting-machines-removed/507-8c96ed32-3b5a-45ac-9d03-e6cd3f971739) to the Postal Service, many of the letter sorting machines are being replaced with newer, more efficient machines (i.e. that require fewer workers to operate) as part of a multi-year effort to better accommodate increasing package volume:

>\[W\]e are retiring older, out of date equipment so that we can expand our newer sorting equipment that can handle as many as 30,000 letters an hour. This will increase our capacity and our efficiency to handle increased package volume as well as any current letter and flat volume. This is a multi-year effort that prepares us for the future.

# What about recent mail delays?


First, it's important to note that mail delays are nothing new, as NPR [notes](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902604303/postal-delays-errors-in-swing-states-loom-over-election):

>Any other year, a steady underperformance of mail delivery in swing states would go unnoticed. This year, though, the delivery rates released Monday have taken on outsized importance: They may foreshadow ballot counting controversies to come.

However, we're in a global pandemic, which is exacerbating problems:

>On-time mail delivery nationally already is suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, presenting a worrisome picture for November as a rapidly rising number of people choose to steer clear of COVID-19 and vote by mail.

Case in point: Fedex, a private company, has been [suffering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fedex-usa/covid-19-delivery-surge-strains-fedex-service-opening-doors-for-ups-idUSKBN2413GV) from mail delays due to the virus. In no way can this be attributed to sabotage by Trump, as is being implied in discussions of similar delays at USPS:

>While every U.S. package carrier is fighting to manage unexpected demand for home deliveries of bicycles, patio furniture, medicine and food, FedEx entered the pandemic in turnaround mode and is grappling with an inflexible business structure that is contributing to service disruptions in California and Michigan.  


>For two Mondays in a row, FedEx told San Bernardino, California-based Pacific Mountain Logistics it would not make scheduled Ground pickups until Thursday, Chief Executive B.J. Patterson said.  


>The delay is not limited to FedEx’s Ground division that focuses on e-commerce packages. Service at FedEx Express - which caters mostly to business deliveries - also is affected, said Patterson, who has been a FedEx customer for a decade.

Now, it is true that Postmaster General DeJoy's streamlining efforts may result in mail being delayed by a day if there is *already* a delay getting it on the truck, as [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/) by the Washington Post:

>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told employees to leave mail behind at distribution centers if it delayed letter carriers from their routes, according to internal USPS documents obtained by The Washington Post...  

 
>“If the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day,” according to a document titled, “New PMG’s \[Postmaster General’s\] expectations and plan.” Traditionally, postal workers are trained not to leave letters behind and to make multiple delivery trips to ensure timely distribution of letters and parcels.

However, as alluded to in the document, the purpose of this is to *encourage* workers to meet deadlines, reduce the need for perpetual overtime (a significant driver of costs), and ultimately make the Postal Service *more* efficient. One can't on the one hand decry the poor financial state of the self-sufficient USPS and, at the same time, criticize good faith efforts to improve its operational efficiency and financial health.

# What about that letter USPS sent warning states it may not be able to deliver ballots in time?


CNN, Washington Post, and others have used these notices as proof that Postmaster General DeJoy's reforms to the Postal Service are designed to disenfranchise voters. The problem, as the Wall Street Journal [notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-postal-services-good-election-advice-11597606836), is that these notices predate DeJoy's tenure as Postmaster General:

>In reality, it’s closer to the opposite: an attempt by the USPS to forestall state election failure. The letters were planned before the new Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, took the reins on June 15. [USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall] sent nearly identical advice to election officials in a May letter posted at USPS.com. Strange public conspiracy.


>“To account for delivery standards and to allow for contingencies (e.g., weather issues or unforeseen events), voters should mail their return ballots at least 1 week prior to the due date,” Mr. Marshall wrote in May. The same rule, he added, should apply to blank ballots: “The Postal Service also recommends that state or local election officials use FirstClass Mail and allow 1 week for delivery to voters.”

Indeed, the Wall Street Journal notes that New York State's own Board of Elections co-chair (and a Democrat) testified that New York should mail ballots to voters sooner, because 7 days isn't enough time for them to be received and returned:

>That seven-day deadline “is unrealistic,” Douglas Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, testified in court last month. The state board has argued for moving it back to 14 days, in line with the USPS suggestion of allowing seven days for delivery each way.

In short, the Postal Service's notice is intended to help ensure more ballots are counted, not the other way around. The Postal Service has given consistent advice for months that states shouldn't wait until the last minute to get ballots in voters' hands.",Conservative,0

In our schools, our newsrooms, even our corporate boardrooms, there is a new far-left fascism that demands absolute allegiance.  If you do not speak its language, perform its rituals, recite its mantras, and follow its commandments, then you will be censored, banished, blacklisted, persecuted, and punished.

Make no mistake: this left-wing cultural revolution is designed to overthrow the American Revolution.  In so doing, they would destroy the very civilization that rescued billions from poverty, disease, violence, and hunger, and that lifted humanity to new heights of achievement, discovery, and progress.

To make this possible, they are determined to tear down every statue, symbol, and memory of our national heritage.

The violent mayhem we have seen in the streets of cities that are run by liberal Democrats, in every case, is the predictable result of years of extreme indoctrination and bias in education, journalism, and other cultural institutions.

Against every law of society and nature, our children are taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but that they were villains.

The radical view of American history is a web of lies — all perspective is removed, every virtue is obscured, every motive is twisted, every fact is distorted, and every flaw is magnified until the history is purged and the record is disfigured beyond all recognition.

And r/topmindsofreddit continues to brigade us. Right now they have 4 posts on their front page targeting us. So clearly the admins have done absolutely nothing. Even when given overwhelming evidence that top minds breaks reddit site wide rules, they choose to sit on their hands. I'm not surprised, this is honestly what I expected. But I'm still disappointed.

They will lie, and do or say anything to win, including hiding their presidential candidate from normal scrutiny by the press, and also scrutiny by us... the citizens that will actually be voting.  

This summer, Democrats have chosen to be on the side of violent looters and rioters. They stood by while our cities, statues, and monuments were burned, looted, and destroyed. They stood by while our nation’s founding was disparaged, our national heritage dishonored, and our police departments vilified.  

Democrats must be defeated in numbers so large there can be no doubt with the election result, or they will never accept that Americans actually admire America’s founding and respect our national heritage, and that we are thankful for the police that protect us all from violent criminals, risking their own lives in the process.",Conservative,0

Making false assumptions is why the Kenosha riots began.  We need every human being to calm down and wait for the facts to come out and once we have the details, we can make a determination at who was at fault.

Cowardice: the projection of the left,15,8umuwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/8umuwi/cowardice_the_projection_of_the_left/,101,1530244738.0,"Recently leftists have been throwing around the word “feckless” with regards to Trump and Republicans- a crazy lady on TV, a squishy Republican attacking actual conservatives, etc. They’re using this term because of their innate behavior of projecting their feelings and motivations onto their opponents.

Their cowardice is on display in a particular way recently with their use of the epithet/descriptor “nazi” (see any number of podcasts and links for citations). This has been in the mainstream more than usual because of border policies and laws actually being enforced and leftists suddenly remembering that Trump is in power, not Obama. When they use this term and purport to mean it then they’re letting us all know that they’re cowards. 

Why? Because if they really do think that we’re all nazis then they should be moving heaven and earth to stop us. Instead they’re sending out a tweet or two and wearing a pink hat and maybe marching in a protest (none of which is particularly outside of the norm 
of their regular behavior). If they really mean the words that are coming out of their mouths then they would be doing far, far more, just as any right thinking person states when pondering the hypothetical of living under Hitler.",Conservative,0

Many of you might know me from this article that I wrote back in February about being a Democrat for 20 years that went to a Trump rally: [https://gen.medium.com/ive-been-a-democrat-for-20-years-here-s-what-i-experienced-at-trump-s-rally-in-new-hampshire-c69ddaaf6d07](https://gen.medium.com/ive-been-a-democrat-for-20-years-here-s-what-i-experienced-at-trump-s-rally-in-new-hampshire-c69ddaaf6d07)

Since then, I've left the Democrat party to become an independent and have decided to vote for the President in November. Because the left is crazy and I don't want them having power, which they crave so so so desperately.

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

"How Democrats plan to steal the 2020 election - Remember, it was the Democrats who cried that Trump would not accept that election’s results – & then, when they lost, spent the next 4 years hysterically and illegally attempting to overturn that election, ripping the country apart in the process",0,ixmeik,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/ixmeik/how_democrats_plan_to_steal_the_2020_election/,841,1600806500.0,"&#x200B;

“It’s  my greatest concern, my single greatest concern,” warns Joe  Biden:  “This president is going to try to steal this election.”

Biden  isn’t alone among Democrats and their media allies suddenly  warning  with great excitement that Republicans are going to lie, cheat,  steal  and collude with foreign powers to win in November. They’re all  saying  it.

“How Trump Will Try to Steal  the Election” headlines a Washington  Monthly story, saying “If voter  suppression and foreign influence don’t  work, he’ll contest the  results.” The Atlantic’s “How Donald Trump Could  Steal the Election”  contends “The president can’t simply cancel the  fall balloting, but his  state-level allies could still deliver him a  second term.” Then  there’s the Guardian, with “‘It’s all rigged’: Trump  foreshadows how he  could undermine presidential election,” and Salon,  with “Here’s how  Trump will steal the 2020 election,” alleging “the  Republican Party has  refined its strategy of voter suppression, voter  intimidation and vote  theft in elections across the country.” But the  grand prize goes to  the Daily Beast for this headline: “This Is How  Republicans Steal an  Election, and Maybe Kill Some Dems in the Process.”

**As usual with the left, it’s all shameless straight-up projection** –  accusing conservatives of the precise sins and crimes they themselves  commit.

Remember,  it was the Democrats who bitterly complained in 2016  that Trump would  not accept that election’s results – and then, when  they lost, spent  the next four years hysterically and illegally  attempting to overturn  that election, ripping the country apart in the  process.

But  now it’s 2020, and the left is in total war mode, deploying its entire  arsenal of weapons, from vote fraud of every sort, to blaming every  societal problem – especially those they themselves created – on  Trump,  to Big Tech censorship of conservative media and purposeful   manipulation of millions of “undecided” votes, to brazenly portraying  Donald Trump as another Hitler.

**During  every election cycle, Democrats reflexively accuse Republicans  of  racism-motivated “voter suppression,” simply because the GOP  believes  voters should identify themselves before voting, to prove they  are  actually eligible to cast a ballot.**

In  truth, however, it is the Democratic Party whose entire growth   strategy relies on various forms of voter fraud and abuse – from

\-Encouraging non-citizens to vote (the reason they fiercely oppose the  most sensible voter ID laws), to

\-Wanting to lower the voting age to 16, to

\- Insisting that incarcerated criminals including mass-murdering  terrorists be allowed to vote, to

\- Demanding universal vote-by-mail, to

\- Ballot harvesting, to

\- Eliminating the Electoral College, to

\- Same-day registration and much more.

The  left’s ultimate get-out-the-vote strategy, of course, is to  import  into the United States an entirely new population of voters, one  not  loyal to either America’s Constitution or cultural values, to  support  Democrats’ unconstitutional, un-American and increasingly  deranged  socialist agenda. Statistically, the vast majority of recent   immigrants, both legal and illegal, favor Democrats.

“Just consider this,” says Whistleblower Editor and bestselling  author David Kupelian:

**“If  the Democrats and their Deep State and media  allies were willing to  illegally spy on Donald Trump, charge him with  colluding with America’s  enemies – essentially treason – while knowing  full well it was all a  lie; if they were perfectly willing to pervert  and corrupt the most  powerful and revered institutions of the federal  government from the  FBI to the DOJ; if they were willing to conduct  transparently farcical  impeachment hearings over a phone call they  didn’t like; if they are  now fine with politicizing the coronavirus  pandemic to cause as much  panic, fear, anxiety, suffering, financial  stress, joblessness and  general misery as possible for political gain;  and if they are willing  to flat-out lie their heads off day after day to  the American public –** ***what would they not do now,*** **to defeat Trump in the home stretch of 2020’s do-or-die election?”**

"To Everyone Who Thinks Cruz's Vastly Superior Grassroots Support Is ""Unfair"" I Have This Suggestion: Stop Whining, and Get Involved.",18,4e6syn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4e6syn/to_everyone_who_thinks_cruzs_vastly_superior/,223,1460340048.0,"The complaints I've been seeing lately from Trump fans are insulting, and frankly childish. Here's my take on a few gripes I've been seeing lately.

* **Objection:** Cruz is trying to ""steal"" the election from Trump!  
* **Response:** Trump, despite what he may think, is not ""entitled"" to any delegates anywhere. He signed up to campaign as a republican candidate. No one forced him into that, it was his choice to do so. It is ignorant and foolish of him to suggest that, having pledged to play by the rules and follow the process in this party, he now thinks he is owed something he is not. He's acting like a spoiled brat.  

* **Objection:** Trump has more votes! His nomination is the ""will of the people!""  
* **Response:** There are a ton of things wrong with this assessment. First of all, a mere 10-15% of the population is not ""the people."" Furthermore, Trump was from the beginning a well-known celebrity from a much talked-about reality show, as well as various books and marketing schemes. He had massive name recognition from the start, giving him a peculiar advantage in populism over others more qualified than him. Furthermore, he's received an obscene amount of free media coverage for saying outrageous things. People like him can win a lot of votes just by stirring people up temporarily. The Founders of this nation recognized that people like him would win nominations all the time if he could just get a plurality with tactics like these. As a result, the process was intentionally designed to give _some_ weight to populism, and _some_ weight to intelligent candidates who do the work of researching the process and figuring it all out.  

* **Objection:** Cruz's campaign is making ""shady"" deals behind the scenes to win delegates!  
* **Response:** This demonstrates a grating ignorance of the nomination process. Cruz's campaign has built up an army of volunteers who believe strongly in his message of strong national security, state's rights, smaller federal government, and constitutional liberty. They have sent the emails, written their representatives, made phone calls, and put their valuable time and effort into getting things done in this delegate election and nomination process. It is absolutely ***disgusting*** to say that what those volunteers are doing with all their hard work  is ""shady"", just because they care enough about the nation and conservative values to to play by the rules and put in the effort to see a well-qualified nominee make it through.  

* **Objection:** The primaries and the general should be entirely democratic! This constitutional republic stuff is too complicated!  
* **Response:** My brother calls Trump the ""Taylor Hicks"" of the primaries. Remember him? He was an American Idol contestant with a lot of flash and pizzazz and very little substantive musical talent. He won the popular vote and therefore the contest, and was immediately signed for a record deal as per the contest's victory contract. However, a peculiar thing happened once his contract came up for renewal: the record label dropped him like a bad habit. Why? Because his music sucked, and no one was buying it any more. He had sailed through the contest with wild, flamboyant appeal, but when it came down to it, he couldn't deliver real results. It's the perfect analogy for Trump, and it should give you some clue as to why it takes more than here-and-now popularity to win a nomination.

#If you want different results, you're going to have to become more involved. You're going to have to get to know those dreaded ""politicians"" you claim to hate so much. You're going to have to learn some things about civics, and get educated on the rules of the parties in power. You're going to have to do more than just whine and cry and complain that things are this way. Get back to us once you do. Until then, all I can hear from you is a lot of vapid, childish moaning and groaning that will be rewarded with more strife and division.

**Edit:** I touched on this, but I really want to emphasize something. The volunteers across the country who are helping Cruz win delegates, both bound and unbound, and in states with presidential preference votes and without them, are NOT the ""establishment"", ""elites"", or ""shills"". Those accusations are frankly absurd. These are simply people who are engaged in their communities. Stop denigrating them with these ridiculous labels just because they got off their backsides last year and started making things happen.",Conservative,0

If they popped you in the nose, does that make you a fascist?  This is how antifa wants it.  For too long, reddit has coddled its violent left-wing communities.  It's not The_Donald out there rioting, burning things and shooting people and cops.

And we here on conservative subreddits have watched this happen for so long.  The scumbag left gets its share of tolerance, but the moment a poster here says, ""If someone comes on my property and tries to harm me or my family, I will defend my home and loved ones...""  Someone hits the, ""threatens or harasses"" report reason.  

But today there's a top post on the antifa subreddit.  And it's a hum dinger.  The revolutionary terrorists are mad that the President said that they are terrorists.  And they go on to SHOW us all that they ARE terrorists with ""terrorist privilege"".  

I guess today is ""tolerate a terrorist"" day.  But any further tolerance of this is reddit tolerating terrorists every day.  Well *some* terrorists.

This is a bit of a deep dive and it's a boring effort-post.  It's not a snappy meme or short article about things.  I hope you'll join me as I show you what we are dealing with, because I'm seeing boomer talking heads on TV saying, *""I have no idea where all of these miscreants on the streets came from!""*  That's because they've missed all the slicey boi Robespierre wannabes that have been calling for blood running down the streets of the USA for YEARS now.  That's right, that Dew-swilling, tendie muncher who used to satisfy him/herself by snidely typing ""America delenda est"" on the internet and using the Red World mod while playing Kaiserreich is on the streets now.

And they WANT you to know who they are all while recoiling that the President said that they are a terrorist group.  The left was VERY KEEN to have the DOJ investigating ""right-wing terror"" in the USA.  They assured us that it's the only **legit** terror in the USA.  Otherwise why would the DOJ be investigating it?  Well, it's time for the spotlight of justice to shine on these left-wingers who want communist revolution and destruction.  Fair's fair, Che.  Time to pay attention to the psychos behind the soy curtain.

Let's look first at [the original post on the antifa subreddit.](https://imgur.com/a/ohUdMfg)

>I am an academic who teaches and studies the rise and fall of Fascism. I am literally anti-fascist by trade. 

Argument from authority.  ""Guys, I literally teach this stuff!""  Yes, Karl, no one's shocked that academia is full of leftism.  We've known for awhile.  It doesn't make you any smarter than anyone else.  Of course, our beloved professor immediately brings up Hitler.  

>""It became illegal to be associated with the Communist party. ""

I'm not a fan of commies.  Not a fan of Nazis, either.  I think the government needs eyeballs on anyone associated with either of these political philosophies.  What about you?

>Declaring the loose concept of being against Fascism to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did but skips several of the steps. We all know how it ends. We aren't even starting in February. We are starting in March.

Trump isn't declaring the philosophy of ""being against fascism"" against the law.  If he was...most of our politicians would go to jail.  Because I can't think of any declared ""fascist"" among them.  Opposing communism isn't fascism.  It's common sense.

>This man can't be allowed to stay in office. If he does. If this movement loses momentum. The people of the United States aren't the only ones who lose. Everyone loses. The world loses. 

(Our OP is going to make it clear later that he is calling for us to get rid of Trump *by any means*...)

>Get out there. Get angry. Don't back down. For all our sakes. Please, don't back down.

(We have riots happening.  This ""professor"" who spells center ""centre"" later on is egging on these riots.  Why is reddit allowing a foreigner to encourage rioting in the USA?)

>Nixon resigned under protests, Mubarak was listed in Egypt after the Arab Spring, Marie Antoinette was beheaded and Mussolini was strung up by protestors at a gas station.

>There's more than one way to skin a cat. Vote, but be ready when the election is an inevitable sham.

#This is **inexcusable** reddit.  

#Ban this subreddit, already.  This foreign professor is encouraging violent revolution and encouraging killing our President.  ENOUGH REDDIT!

This is bad...yeah? But the comments DEVOLVE all of this further.  I will put the shots of ALL the comments at the end of the post, but let's just look at SOME of them.

#It was called the ""Reign of Terror"" for a reason.  So when you are invoking it, don't be surprised when we all call you terrorists...

[Fight fascism with people's war!  Elections no!  People's war yes!](https://imgur.com/a/TzGUnM8)

This is a declaration of civil war.  And it's upvoted!

[Here's where they say that they are ""good"" with Stalin.  Making common cause with Stalinists is fine and, in fact, if you criticize Stalinists on the antifa subreddit your comment will be removed because you are ""causing leftist infighting.""](https://imgur.com/a/0KrsZ4t)

[""Biden is not anti-fascism.""](https://imgur.com/a/wZvpx5Z)

These people will not even be satisfied if Biden wins.  Do you understand yet?  It's not TRUMP that they oppose at all.  They oppose capitalism.  They are upset that Biden's campaign doesn't embrace socialism.  These are not anti-fascists...these are violent left-wing revolutionaries and they are announcing as much while also pretending to be offended that the nation has noticed.

[RED FOREVER!  STAY STRONG COMRADES!](https://imgur.com/a/RMUuSzo)

You think this is a larp, but that account has a three year history of posting lefty shit on reddit.

[This is very important.  Here is our OP noting that Trump was ""taken to a bunker"" and saying that he's NOT ""talking about voting.""  Our OP...is encouraging the masses to take out Trump...and if this isn't getting dodgy enough...](https://imgur.com/a/IB56SUk)

[Another poster says, ""Assassination is always an option...""](https://imgur.com/a/PAA0W2K)

This comment is still there and has been up for two hours now.

#So reddit, are you good with all of this?  Having the antifa subreddit feature a post that calls for civil war, killing the President, overthrowing the government and uniting Stalinists with the rest of the left to form a new revolutionary government that will use guillotines?

God help us.

-Pope Benedict XVI

I chose him because I wanted a Catholic sidebar going into Palm Sunday (a.k.a. Passion Sunday, for the Gospel reading) and Holy Week and because he says brilliant things about relativism and how dumb it is. I figured that the subreddit of interest would be appropriate, as well.

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

A message to all of the so-called conservatives celebrating the Supreme Court's striking down of DOMA.,11,1h4cay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1h4cay/a_message_to_all_of_the_socalled_conservatives/,183,1372296601.0,"I've got news for anyone who thinks the Supreme Courts recent decisions favouring gay marriage are good:  

You're not a conservative.

You may be a good person, you may be smart, you even may be right on this issue, but you are not a conservative.

Marriage, in the Western tradition, has been between one man and one woman.  It is the core social institution of our society.  It shapes all aspects of our lives, and most importantly, it shapes how we perpetuate our society, through the bearing and raising of children.

The past 50 years have seen a radical change in a segment of our society's  sexual morality.  Marriage has become deprecated, as has the very notion of sexual morality itself.  Sexual expression has lost its natural allegiance with procreation.  Indeed, the only rule seems to be ""if it feels good, do it"".  Any action between consenting adults is permissible.  You condemn those that would hold to traditional sexual morality as depraved intolerants.  To refuse to celebrate institutionalized sodomy is to be an irrational bigot.

You have gone beyond Libertarianism, and embraced libertinism.

But for all the media propaganda, there remains a moral core of Americans, like myself, who believe that marriage can only be between a man and a woman and that any law that acknowledges otherwise embraces the vilest and most harmful perversity.

We may no longer be a majority, but we are still a plurality.  The wavering moderates are now siding with the sodomy crowd due to a very concerted propaganda campaign promoting institutionalized sodomy.  We are certainly guilty of losing the propaganda war.  Public opinion has swayed one way.  It can still sway back.  It's an ugly term, institutionalized sodomy, isn't it?  If you are a homosexual, it is the only way to consummate your marriage vows.

The legitimization of non-traditional marriage is a radical social change.  A conservative understands that government-mandated social change is a dangerous thing.  Let us not forget that the Supreme Court, by its actions, has through judicial activism struck down the express will of the people and their representatives.  DOMA was a law passed by Congress and signed by the President.  California's Proposition 8 was a direct plebiscite.  In its ruling against both of these, the Supreme Court has taken it upon itself to be an arbiter of morality over the will of the people.  This is repugnant to any believer in republican democracy -- to have a court of 9 tell a country of 300 million that they know better than we do as to what constitutes a legitimate marriage.

If you don't like DOMA, get Congress to repeal it.  If you don't like Proposition 8, get the citizens of California to repeal it.  Don't tell me you are a conservative because you think 5 judges should set the moral agenda for a nation.

This fight isn't over.  Those of us that believe in the inviolable sanctity of traditional marriage will continue to fight the popular fight against it.  We will not cede the Republican party to libertines.  And if the libertines take over the party, we will form our own party.

A conservative is not pleased when a slim majority of judges overturns centuries of common sense.  So congratulations on your ""victory"", just don't insult our intelligence by calling it a conservative victory.

**edit: ** 
The title is a statement from Rep. Allen West (R-FL) 

Is r/conservative so socially liberal that we abandon Christian values for those of the liberal elites? 

But how do you go about destroying society? Where do you direct the blow so it will do the most damage? In his Theses on Feuerbach, Karl Marx provided the answer: destroy the traditional family.

If they are allowed to marry and the government recognizes their marriages, then we will need to change what we teach our children in schools and tell them that when they reach the age of 18 they can marry either a man or a woman.

Legalizing gay “marriage” would leave society destroyed, because the family is the basic cell of society, and if I destroy the family or undermine it, I am destroying society.

With their tremendous, immense political clout, gays could easily attain matrimonial assets enjoyed by married couples (i.e., hospital visitations, inheritance issues, social security benefits, etc.) but that's not what this activism is about.
They want it ALL, they want to RULE, and they want people who dissagree with them thrown in JAIL.",Conservative,0

A note to Gary Johnson/Ron Paul supporters,8,12a5gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/12a5gp/a_note_to_gary_johnsonron_paul_supporters/,204,1351556989.0,"As a conservative republican, I want to appeal to those compelled to vote for Gary Johnson this election. Particularly those who feel more aligned with the conservative side of politics.

As I'm sure most of you are aware, this election is, to paraphrase Joe Biden, a big f'n deal. With that importance, every vote is going to count in swing states and in some instances, even states that are ""likely"" one way or the other. There are several states that are locks for either Romney or Obama, but many of us live in states that could very likely go either way. I happen to live in NH, an obvious swing state. But you may live in states like Oregon or Minnesota, states that could wind up being a toss up on election day.

To say that you're voting for Gary Johnson in this election is a throw away of a very important vote, in my opinion. I've been watching Johnson supporters on this subreddit give countless reasons why their vote for Gary Johnson is a good one. The bottom line is, it's not. It means nothing to the political process. And if you're a conservative leaning individual who's going to vote Johnson or write-in Paul, you're essentially giving Obama another vote.

Obviously we all have differences in our opinions. Is Mitt Romney the best possible choice for Republicans? No. I would've preferred Rubio or Christie as our first choice. Obviously you would've liked Gary Johnson or Ron Paul. But Mitt Romney is our candidate. And the goal here is to vote out president Obama. If I have to choose between Romney or Obama, I have to vote Romney. You should feel that way, too.

Gary Johnson knows he can't win, and he knows that running as an independent will likely take votes away from Romney. So why is he doing it? Likely for exposure for a run in 2016. Likely for the same reasons many of you are voting for him- because you just don't like the other two candidates. But remember, the only one you're impacting is Romney. Obama won't get the message because he'll get the support he needs from his base to win. So in the end, with your Johnson vote, you're voting in the guy you like **the least.**

My hope, as a conservative, is that all of us conservatives, in all our variations, can stand shoulder to shoulder in opposition of the democrat agenda. I don't know about you, but I fear what another four years of Obama would look like. And I was lucky enough to have a job throughout his presidency. But I know plenty of people who don't, and haven't had luck with many opportunities. I fear for them. And the millions of others who work at companies that are just getting by, or who are starting to slip. It's a dreadful situation for too many of us out there. Obama had his chance to fix it but he couldn't. Now it's time to give Romney a chance.

In 2000 we were 560+ votes away from an Al Gore presidency. This election can be that tight. Don't waste your vote away on Gary Johnson. Don't lose your voice at a time when we all need to be heard. There's too much riding on this one to be ignored. As a conservative, I hope you're with Mitt on this election day. Thanks for reading.",Conservative,0

Why SJW Crybabies are wrong about “Baby it’s Cold Outside”,33,a5ujvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/a5ujvz/why_sjw_crybabies_are_wrong_about_baby_its_cold/,72,1544744275.0,"First, let’s begin by looking at the lyrics.  Any discussion about the song must begin with an understanding of what’s actually going on.

_________________________________________________________

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside

I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside

This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in

So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?

Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar

So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry

Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there

Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no - Mind if I move in closer?

At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out

Ah, but it's cold outside


I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there

Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there

You've really been grand - Thrill when you touch my hand

Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow

At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died

I really can't stay - Get over that hold out

Ah, but it's cold outside

Oh, baby, it's cold outside

Oh, baby, it's cold outside

_____________________________________________________

There are a few things that have to be understood:

First, the woman in song has never said no.  This cannot be overstated: she said that she ought to say no, but at no point has she made it clear that she wanted to stop.  It’s important to know that although she’s using “can’t” and “shouldn’t,” she has made no determination to stop the interaction, leave, or otherwise end the night.

Second, this woman is indecisive, but she’s leaning towards staying.  She’s playing hard to get a little, and she’s clearly wanting to stay with the guy.  She’s giving excuses, but she herself isn’t trying stand her ground.  She’s trying to feel good about her probable decision to stay.  Is this a statement about women in general?  Of course not.  This is a small scene between one man and one woman.

Third, there is no force or even explicit pressure from the man.  There’s implication, there’s a bit of seduction (of the 1940s style), but there’s nothing more.  Her arguments, though potentially valid, are almost all social in nature; his responses are personal and practical in nature.

Finally, the resolution (of a sort) is never stated.  By stating that it’s a song about date rape, SJWs are extrapolating well beyond what the song says.  Also, SJWs are applying their own views and notions to the language of the 1940s.  That would be like blaming Dwight Eisenhower for not using supersonic jet planes in WWII.  SJWs are merely assuming that the evening ends with sex and that she never wanted it, even though the song never says so.  The song is implicative on purpose. It draws images in people’s minds because there is so much that the song does not say.

Let me finish by saying that I do not like, and never have liked, this song.  I don’t like the implicative nature, and I am not comfortable with “sexy” Christmas songs.  The notion of Christmas is important enough not to cheapen with such nonsense.  I’ve never called for the song to be pulled off the radio and I’ve never complained publicly: I just don’t listen to it.

**EDIT**

I was recently accused of being a liar and not putting in lyrics to my own advantage.  I don't like being called a liar, and as evidence of at least my innocence of copying and pasting lyrics *as they were*, if not copying the best version, I am submitting a link to the website from which I got the lyrics. 

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shehim/babyitscoldoutside.html

Again, I am not here to base my arguments on lies. I did not look at any other lyrics websites.  Perhaps there are other versions of the song sung which make it out the woman gives a hard no, but this one didn't, and I have no memory from my youth a hard no being in there.  I claim ignorance in such matters, but I forcefully denounce the idea that I lied.",Conservative,0

Long time conservative liberal here. The Marxist Democratic agendas are getting out of hand. The fact they are going to take down Teddy FREAKING Roosevelt’s Statue drove me back to reality.,1777,hdiup5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hdiup5/long_time_conservative_liberal_here_the_marxist/,503,1592818734.0,"I realized that the Democratic institution is a wolf in sheep’s clothing after 10 years. I used to be an absurdly left person who was also trying to figure out my gender identity. I also was calling for forced equality (due to myself identifying as a Bisexual at the time and had very, very Egalitarian views). I was not listening to my conservative friends how my views were toxic and actually FORCING people to accept equality and also FORCING people to accept my views and my views only. 

What the fuck was I thinking? Democrats are basically making people accept an ideology that’s really 1% of the population and a very vocal one for sure with deep  fucking pockets. Look at the fucking example of how the Left wants to take down Teddy Roosevelt’s state in front of a NYC museum. It’s ridiculous. What’s next? FDR? George Washington? Thomas Jefferson? 

I don’t see Asians (I’m asian) complaining about FDR how he forced Japanese Americans into intern camps am I? I hate the fact that they did so, but we have to understand history and why they did it. If it was the Australians who bombed Pearl Harbor, I am sure that FDR would’ve done the same to the Australians.

Also, yeah, we going to get rid of Thomas Jefferson’s achievements too since he owned slaves? Yeah, let’s also bomb Mt. Rushmore cause why not. They not POC. Ridiculous. 

Also, recently, after many years of therapy, had a realization that my bisexual tendencies were something of a mental illness. You see I was abused as a kid by my church. (Still am a Christian, but distrustful of people, cause people are at fault, not the church) Most of the gays know this btw. Many of us will not admit it. We know being gay, bi, or lesbian isn’t the natural order of things and it’s a mental illness tied with childhood trauma and development. 

This shit that is happening is basic takeover of Communists and I will not allow the USA turning into a free for all dystopia. I will be voting for Trump. Not voting for a child rapist either. Fuck Biden. 

Also, I’m sorry for not listening.

Edit: Also, I am not really for wealth distribution, I’ll just be straight and honest with you all. I’m wealthy and it’s my hard earned cash. My dad was an immigrant and through him and his hard work to send me to college and receive a great education, I achieved the American Dream. The Manifest Destiny. I am very economically right.

No one can deny that the unborn child is a distinct being, that it is human, and that it is alive. It is unjust, therefore, to deprive the unborn child of its fundamental right to life on the basis of its age, size, or condition of dependency."" Mother Theresa  

To say that a mother's body trumps that of the unborn child is a denial of natural biological reproductive function, and denies the child the right to Life he so deserves. ""Reproductive rights"" are therefore false right's granted to a tyrannical sovereignty to be used to snuff the life out of those that are weaker, smaller, or more dependent than others. Just as a tyrannical leader does not have the right to put innocent lives to death, no too, should those with child be allowed to punish him for simply being the result of a purposefully designed biological function of called reproduction. 

To equate a fertilized egg as that of a clump of cells or to a virus is to ignore the fundamental differences between a clump of cells like that of skin or liver or a virus and the newly conceived baby, it's a scientific fact that a clump of skin cells does not grow up and become a separate individual nor does a virus. Again, to equate them as all the same is a form of willful ignorance.

As someone who analyzes data for a living, I am exposed to this on a daily basis. Liberals seem to miss this basic point that correlation does not equal causation. 

As an example, just because the weather may be unnaturally hot for the last 3 years, and the amount of craft beer sales have as well, does not mean that the unnaturally hot climate is causing a craft beer surge. 

Time to bring back this logic to our country and the world!

Edit: there seems to be a big climate change discussion going on below. I didn't use the above example as a denial of climate change, I used it as a hyperbole. Now, that being said, there of course is climate change, the climate is always changing. The question that I have never seen undeniable proof of is the exact amount we, as humans, are contributing to its ""unnatural"" change. At the worst it's minimal, at the best it's insignificant from what I have researched, and many of the panels of the ""97% of climate change scientists"", are not a statistically significant number, and many of those on the panels didn't actually conduct the research.

> The common wisdom holds that “both parties” have to appeal to the extremes during the primary and then move to the center for the general election. To the contrary, both parties run for office as conservatives. Once they have fooled the voters and are safely in office, Republicans sometimes double-cross the voters. Democrats always do.

The answer isn't to run from our principles.

You claim that abortion and gay marriage are killing the republican party. 

That is not the problem. More people identify as Pro-Life, it's just our politicians are not doing a good job putting their position out. Akin is not intelligent. And Murdoch had his words twisted. It is not about rape it is about life. We need to better get this message across. 

As far as gay marriage goes, I believe marriage should be a religious only institution and the govt. Shouldn't be involved. Both candidates believed it should be left up to the states yet many people still believed Romney wanted to ban gay marriage. 

Immigration? How far are we going to go? It is obvious that if we go back in our laws we will gain more voters, but is that what we need? Do we go back on our values for votes? 

Women's rights? This issue isn't about women. It's about the government providing services for extra non necessities. 


The whole argument against Romney is that he only cares about the rich, wants to ban abortions, ban gay marriage, ban birth control, and how he hates illegals.

Stop falling back on your ideals in order to become more popular. Just get your message across better.",Conservative,0

Why NeverTrump is not Conservative,1,4loj0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4loj0r/why_nevertrump_is_not_conservative/,127,1464623591.0,"While most of the Republican Party has fallen behind Trump, and 86% of Romney voters say they will vote for him, compared to only 5% who say they won't, many on this sub still take a ""#NeverTrump"" position. They justify this by saying they're standing on principle as a conservative. They say they'll vote for a Libertarian candidate or a different 3rd party, or they just won't vote. And that's their right as a citizen in a Democracy. They can vote for whoever they want. But what they should know is that abstaining from voting for Trump does NOT make them more conservative than any of the rest of us who will hold our noses and vote for him. It makes them LESS Conservative. Donald Trump, out of the 17 Republican candidates, was probably my 16th choice (above only Ben Carson). I do not like Donald Trump as a candidate or as a person. HOWEVER, I want the most Conservative President possible. I want a person who will nominate a Conservative Supreme Court Justice. I want a person who will not veto Conservative bills, and unfortunately, given our choices, this person is Donald Trump. If you want to lose the 2nd amendment, if you want to allow the slaughter of unborn babies to continue forever, if you want to allow the Supreme Court to rip the constitution to shreds forever, if you want amnesty for illegal immigrants, if you want raised taxes and an expanded welfare state, you should vote for Hillary or a 3rd party as it's essentially the same anyways, if you vote for a 3rd party, you're taking a vote away from the most Conservative candidate who could actually win. If you want something else, if you actually want Conservative policies done, like cutting taxes, cutting spending, stopping illegal immigration, then Donald Trump is your best choice. And THAT's what makes you a Conservative. Choosing the guy who will be the best for the country with Conservative policies and not abstaining or protest-voting. The last time people hated the Republican nominee was 1964 with Barry Goldwater. Lots of people thought he was too dangerous like Trump. Many abstained or voted Dem.  Guess what happened? Massive expansion of the welfare state that will never go away and extremely liberal Supreme Court justices who voted for the state-sanctioned slaughter of unborn babies.


So NeverTrumpers, feel free to vote for whoever you want this fall. But just know that abstaining from voting for Trump does not make you more Conservative, it makes you less Conservative, as a vote that is not for Trump is a vote for Hillary. The rest of us will be voting for the guy who, while flawed, has an extremely Conservative immigration policy crafted by Jeff Sessions. The guy who has an extremely Conservative tax plan championed by Larry Kudlow as the best of any Republican candidate. The guy who proposed a list of Supreme Court Justices that Mike Lee said was the best, most conservative list he's ever seen. We all want Conservative policies done and Liberal policies stopped, so we, the great silent majority of Conservatives will be voting for Trump. While I encourage you all to do the same, as I know you all are good Conservatives and we're all on the same side, you do not have to join us. However, as I said before, just know, not voting for Trump does not make you more of a principled Conservative. It makes you less of one.",Conservative,0

Why has mass shooting have continual rise since the 50's?,0,cmkaj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/cmkaj6/why_has_mass_shooting_have_continual_rise_since/,104,1565084858.0,"We all feel it.  People are shooting at random strangers at an increasing rate since the 50's.  Its had a steady climb and nothing seems to explain it.  After all, while gun ownership has gone up and murder rates have gone down, mass shootings keep climbing.  Now, if we look at it pragmatically, mass murder really isn't a big problem.  Out of the 36K deaths from gunshots last year, if we subtract 22k which are suicides, we get 14K gun deaths.  Do you know how many of those 14,000 deaths are from maniacs who go to a public place and unleash on the public?  Less than 1%. Yup.  Well, that's because the FBI and DOJ doesn't consider gang drive by shooting as mass murder.  If we included those, the percent would be a lot higher.  But still.  The point remains.

Why do people keep killing complete strangers?  What has changed in the past 50 years that would explain this?  Answer: Religion.  Yup.  People have lost religion. 

Now mind you, I am not, nor have I ever been a religious person.  I used to think religion, especially Christianity, was bad Why?  Because of programming.  Literally, all through life, I was taught how bad religion was.  Now I realize how wrong I was.

You see, it all comes down to this.  Do you know how much of the population are sociopaths/psychopaths?  By the best estimates from science, 4%.  For every 100 people you meet, 4 are social/psychopaths.  Wow.  That's a lot.

So what made the spike in random shootings?  Well, you see, psychopaths respond to one thing, and one thing only.  Fear.  They are incapable of feeling anything but fear.  Well, what did religion instill in people?  Fear.

In other words, religion kept these psychopaths in check.  But now that religion is no longer curbing their desire to kill, they are having a field day.  

You wanna know what my solution to end mass shooting is?  It's Sunday school.  I kid you not.  The solution to mass shooting is not gun control.  It's not mental health.  It's not tolerance or wiping out white supremacy.  It's not about anything but teaching kids that killing is wrong.  It's that simple.  It's about instilling values and fear of god in kids.  If you fear God, you won't shoot up a school.  It's as simple as that!  And this is coming from a person who doesn't even believe in God.  Go figure....",Conservative,0

Isn't trapping a guy under rubble (with no trial) where he dies slowly over days after having his arm blown off a little bit painful?

I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

It's frustrating for me as an American to be witnessing the Republican party attempting to shift dramatically towards an anti-war pro-whistleblower party with a consistent small-government message who reaches to the political center, but progressives hyperfocus on single social issues, something that conservatives ARE SEEN TO BE GUILTY OF. We couldn't have asked for a better Trojan horse in anyone else than Ron Paul, not in the sense that he is the perfect leader, but rather his voice serves to be the perfect foil in a sea of noise to help guide the overall mainstream narrative that is the American story. I hope Ron Paul wins the nomination because this country would benefit from a series of debates between Obama and Paul better than any other scenario. Please join me, not as an Occupier, Tea Partier, Republican or Democrat, but as an American, in pushing for Ron Paul to win the Republican nomination for an exciting 2012 election season that regardless of who wins, We The People will have everything to gain if Paul becomes the voice of the Republican party. http://www.bluerepublican.org/",Progressive,0

If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts.

"For those of you voting for Jill Stein, please look at her electoral history",15,4z1l24,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/4z1l24/for_those_of_you_voting_for_jill_stein_please/,142,1471914732.0,"Here are the races Jill Stein ran for in her entire political career:

She lost all but two of her races .

Stein lost her MA governor race - she came in third at 3.5%.

She lost her 2004 State Senate run for MA's 9th Middlesex District ( 59.6%-21.3%).

She lost the race for MA's Secretary of the Commonwealth after being nominated (she got 18% of the vote).

She lost her second [2010] MA governor race with 1.4% of the vote.

The only official office she has EVER won was Town Meeting Representative, in 2005 and 2008. Given this performance, does anyone actually believe she can win a Presidential contest?

Throughout all of her runs - and still now - MA is reliably blue, meaning that MA would have been much easier for Jill Stein to win than an entire country where close to half of the voting population is Republican.

Now, the question is this: Do you actually care who our next President is? Do you care who is elected? And are you willing to gamble with our country's future?",Progressive,0

Anyone else noticing this breed of intolerance within progressive communities? What are your experience with it?,4,3bf9xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3bf9xd/anyone_else_noticing_this_breed_of_intolerance/,8,1435544829.0,"For me, I like to think I am an open minded/progressive thinker, yet a lot of my colleagues in the name of tolerance, forward thinking and acceptance for all are actually becoming very intolerant of people with (even slight) difference of opinions. Almost as if the whole progressiveness is just a gimmick for moral high-ground. In the name of political correctness, its like context does not matter... as soon as race, gender or ethnicity is involved, if you are not saying the same things as they are indoctrinated to believe... they will throw words at you like bigot, racist, sexist and etc.


Take for instance, #cancelcolbert. where a satirical joke (which is making fun of how racist a name like redskins for a NFL team) is blown out of context when Steven Colbert makes fun of bigots supporting it by saying ""I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever"" . The joke was to show a parallel that would seem outrageously offensive like the redskins should be to Americans... and the progressive community attacks Colbert as if he is the racist.  It gets so ridiculous that the woman who started it, when disucssing it in this video... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNK-e6nnFGY
tells Josh that as a white male in america, he has no right to say anything on the subject matter because ...you know white privilege. Belittling the white man's intelligence and brushing it off, to which Josh of course does not respond to well and belittles her and all the sudden it is all Josh's fault and the conversation ends. Really interesting...


Now i am from a Muslim descent, progressive thinkers love to defend my people and call any who just criticize the doctrine of Islam as bigots/islamphobes. Never mind the bigots for a second but even people who are discussing the danger that lurks in Islamic doctrine. Which is sweet of white liberals to do, thank you for defending my people... i guess. But these same people mock Christianity with no end... Almost a double standard, even though I agree there is an Islamist problems stemming out of, not just politics but, religion itself. This does not mean Muslims are bad, my mom is a devout Muslim and a very kind and generous person, the polar opposite of what ISIS is. But i would be a fool in to thinking that ISIS is not justifying its warmongery via Islamic texts. That is what the whole issue with Sam Harris and Ben Afflick on Real Time With Bill Maher was about. Again Ben being the progressive, not allowing any kind of ideas outside of progressive PC brand to even be expressed without getting zealot about his own position. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60 


Transgender is also interesting, not Catliyn Jenner, I support the idea behind it, sure do what ever you like but I do not see how that family (Kardasians) has any value to society for me to even care. I will say it seems weird, sure, can i have that opinion without being attacked? However to these kinds of progressives, It seems like another ploy to just sit around, see who has a bigoted (a.k.a not praising her) opinion and attack them. However the transgender Issue i want to bring up isn't even Catliyn. The example I want to direct in this conversation is about Fallon Fox. For those who do not know, she was a male MMA fighter(cage fighter), who decided to have a sex change and now fights woman. Can we have a conversation about this? All of the sudden anyone who says no to her fighting woman (i.e. UFC not supporting her and not allowing her to fight woman) gets criticized for being bigots. Here is the interesting fact, Fallon Fox, as a man was a terrible fighter, as soon as she had her sex change, started utterly dominating woman in her division. 
Her last opponent that she destroyed in 40 seconds said this ""’I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night. I can’t answer whether it’s because she was born a man or not because I’m not a doctor. I can only say, I’ve never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right,” she stated. “Her grip was different, I could usually move around in the clinch against other females but couldn’t move at all in Fox’s clinch…"" Link: http://www.cagepotato.com/after-being-tkod-by-fallon-fox-tamikka-brents-says-transgender-fighters-in-mma-just-isnt-fair/
But progressives who see the issue from a surface level, say well its okay for her to do this, she is a woman now and if you disagree or even want a discussion on the subject, you are a disgusting bigot. Even Joe Rogan who is a very progressive thinker is getting attacked by the far left.


Of course this all stems from stupidity not progressive thinking more so than anything else because its about moral high-ground... not understanding the deeper conversations. One class on racism in college is enough to shoot these kinds of people off on their journey. My own anecdote that got me writing...Today, I referred to my friends as ""brothers"" who happened to be black and the white girl started ranting on how I can not say brother, its exclusively allowed in the black community among each other.. I had to explain to her my brother was referring to how deep me and my friends relationship is. I was not mocking them by saying ""brothas"". Then i started wondering IF i say the word ""my niggas"" which, also among people who are not nuts, means a very close bond... I wonder how much her moral high ground duty would have sky rocketed then. Even though I freely use that word with my black friends.

Warren Would Be Winning. Sanders Won't.,0,3hnfpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3hnfpg/warren_would_be_winning_sanders_wont/,8,1440055658.0,"I have a front row seat as an Iowa Democrat. Disclaimer: I'm organizing the caucuses for my county so I'm staying neutral. So take this as an observation, not an ""attack.""

Bernie Sanders is doing better than I expected, but I think he's at a plateau. The barrier is one thing he can't change: gender.

Don't fall into a trap of ""everybody *I* know is for Bernie."" Countless elections have been lost with that mindset. The world is bigger than your social media circle.

There is no force in the universe that is going to pry 60something Democratic women away from Hillary and toward a male candidate. They want to see a female president, preferably from their own generation, before they die, they feel like Hillary is the only real possibility, and they feel like it's eight years later than it should have been. Go to a Clinton meeting sometime. It's about 70% female. (And they're NOT here on Reddit.)

No argument Sanders can make, no matter how eloquent, can change this. No amount of scandal is going to matter - it just makes her STRONGER because the true believers think everyone's out to get her.

None of this is an attack on Sanders. It's just a reality. 

And if Sanders is going to actually be the nominee, he and his supporters have to work around this. They need to find a way to make backing him over Hillary be a better choice for women and not be an anti-feminist thing. They have to figure out how to ask those 60-something women, who feel like they were shoved aside in 2008, to wait another eight years, and to accept that The First Woman will come from the next generation and not their own.

I don't know how to do that. If I did I'd be the richest consultant in America.

I know how NOT to do that: Calling people shallow and narrow-minded for caring about the identity politics of gender will backfire badly.

This is why I was ready to back Elizabeth Warren, and why she would have been a stronger challenger than Sanders. She would have taken gender, and age, out of the equation, and it would have all been about issues and personal credibility. (I also like her rhetorical style better than Sanders - says the same thing but in a way more people find appealing.)

A lot of people who were ready to sign on for Warren are hanging back because they don't want to back a male candidate over Hillary. This is ESPECIALLY strong among Iowa Democrats because we spent decades trying to get a woman to Congress and the Republicans beat us to it last year with Joni Ernst.

If Elizabeth Warren had run instead of Sanders, she would be AHEAD of Hillary right now, and might even drive her out of the race with some help from the media and the investigators.

Discuss.

UPDATE: Couple more thoughts.

This isn't just a 60something women thing. It's a 20something women thing too.

And don't underestimate the significance of the Bernie Is Not A Democrat thing. Maybe that makes you like him more. But it makes a lot of people who you don't know like him less, and I think on the whole it's a net loss in votes.

Again, on both these items Warren would have been a stronger challenger.",Progressive,0

Martin O'Malley 2016,2,33yroq,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/33yroq/martin_omalley_2016/,3,1430116165.0,"(I'm re-posting this in order to help spread the word of Martin O'Malley) 

Martin O'Malley is possibly the best option for president America currently has. O'Malley has served as an executive for 15 years. First as the mayor of Baltimore, then as the Governor of Maryland. And now, he is looking at a possible presidential run.

Martin O'Malley has been a proven endorser of progressive issues for a long time. As Governor he passed things such as a Marriage Equality Act, He increased the minimum wage to $10.10, he passed a Gun Law that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands, and he ended the Death Penalty. Those are some very big accomplishments. But possibly more impressive, is the following. As the Governor of Maryland, O'Malley maintained a AAA Bond rating throughout the recession for his state (one of only seven states to do so). Education Week magazine ranked Maryland’s public schools #1 in America for five years in a row, and Maryland has ranked #1 in AP performance for eight consecutive years, according to the College Board. Also Under Governor O’Malley, Maryland was ranked the best state for Women in America! According to the Center For American Progress, “on matters of economics, leadership, and health, women, on average, fared the best in Maryland.” And in the midst of the worst economic downturn in history, Governor O’Malley reformed Maryland’s income tax. Today, 86% of Marylanders pay less in state income taxes than they did before Governor O’Malley took office. Maryland also ranked #1 for innovation and entrepreneurship for three years in a row, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Now those are some real accomplishments. But those accomplishments didn't come free. Early on in his Governorship, O'Malley created a $1 tax on cigarettes, which went to healthcare so 300,000 people who didn't have healthcare could get it (that was before the affordable care act). He raised the corporate income tax by 1%. And one thing he did ask everyone in MD to do was pay one more cent on their sales tax, which made Maryland the 42nd lowest sales tax in the nation. And he created a progressive income tax, in which he asked the top 15% to pay more than the other 85%. All of these lead to those great accomplishments listed above.

All told, Martin O'Malley was an extremely successful Governor, with a great progressive resume. And thats why i'm spreading the word of Martin O'Malley 2016!",Progressive,0

A message from /pol/.,0,3w9n21,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3w9n21/a_message_from_pol/,2,1449805714.0,"Hey guys, its /pol/.

You may be wondering why the world seems to be rejecting your world view and things are sliding to the right. Trump is surging, Europe is going nationalist and fascism is creeping in. Our memes are leaking into mainstream media. I'm going to give you a little insight into what is going on.

You're going to need to accept the possibility that not all of us are hopelessly stupid rubes for any of this to make sense. I just lost 90% of you right there I know, but if any of you are still reading, here it is.

We understand that most people are uninformed, simple and base and that the leaders and influential people in society have to pitch a message that is digestible and understandable and feels good to them. We've learned this from the modern left (which has been wildly successful) and we're using it for our goals now.

Humor is a great way to do this and let's face it, you guys are not funny anymore. You can’t be. Comedy is best when it is offensive and edgy and you can’t be offensive and edgy because you can alienate 90% of your eternally ass raged base with one harmless, slightly politically incorrect joke. Famous, mainstream comedians like Seinfeld and Chris Rock have stated that they can’t do gigs on college campuses because your ideological adherents lose their shit at the first hint of an “offensive” joke. The only comedy you’re allowed to engage in is making fun of dumb, white rednecks and that’s been done to death, its old. Its over. You’re so last century.

We make people laugh and we make them laugh at you. Tumblr and the college commie SJW are the best things that have ever happened to the political right. We would be dead, gone and vanquished if not for this hilarious, low hanging fruit and the more they radicalize the more the right radicalizes in reaction to them.

Some of us like to call you guys the “outrage industrial complex” and its fitting because you guys are all about anger. It feels better to laugh than to grind your teeth and clench your fist in anger. You see, comedy and humor lighten incredibly heavy and taboo subjects. You used to know this and employ it expertly. You used it to usher in and normalize everything that was once forbidden by us. Now its our turn. Also your memes and material is all just so bland and safe because it has to be. You have an incredibly narrow lane to stay in or the rest of your camp will excommunicate you and you’ll have nowhere else to go except to /pol/ with us. That’s how most of us got there by the way. We used to be just like you.

We call them Libertarians in the U.S. We are progressives. 

Our view points are grounded in the ideal of equality whether it's marriage, the marketplace, education, healthcare, or the justice system. 

The term liberal is easily used against us when regressives chose to equate our system with that the National Socialists better known as the Nazis. It's a bullshit argument due to that fact that they were the complete opposite of liberals as well since they were a totalitarian government that controlled all facets of life but our (for a lack of better description) opponents are not always the brightest. Will they still be opposed to our core values if we stopping using incorrect terminology? Sure, they are conservatives which indicates they don't want change unless it restores the previous rights that have been allocated to the rest of the population. 

As progressives, we understand education is the key to better the world around us. We must be open to changing paradigms that don't fit our current views. If new data suggests they are more equitable ways to govern, we should flexible to embrace the change. As progressive, we understand that weak governments lead to very poor societies, culturally and financially. We also understand that every freedom requires an equal responsibility. If you want to own a gun, you should accept some responsibilities that come with them just like you want to drive a car, have a family or own a business. Our government is flawed and needs work but it's better than none or smaller ones (see WV, KS, LA). 

Liberal doesn't fit our moral system. Jesus wasn't a liberal, he was a progressive just like Buddha and other philosophers before him. The idea we should treat everyone around the same is not a liberal idea, it's progressive. If Jesus were liberal, he would argue that each person is indeed an island and should be allowed to do whatever he (or she) wants as long it doesn't impact anyone else. That's not what Jesus said. He said humans should sell their possessions (giving up economic freedom), feed those hungry (thinking of others above yourself), and don't judge others (maybe a little Libertarian). Liberals, by definition, are (lack of better word) self serving. They want to be able to run their business anyway they feel fit, to be allowed to do whatever they want, to discriminate against whoever they want.

Part of me is torn: I don't know whether to 1) defend the ACA by countering the crazy conservatives mindlessly criticizing the ACA with hypocrisy, nonsense, half-truths, and full lies, or whether I should 2) criticize it too, for being so close to the single most conservative health care reform plan proposed in the United States. 

Seriously, the political spectrum has shifted so much that the ****Democrats passed a law which, 20 years prior, was unthinkably, radically right wing.**** But everybody hailed it as a praiseworthy, moderate compromise, except the conservatives, who have forgotten that they came up with the idea, decrying it as liberal socialism on par with nazi fascist communism. 

Why should I defend the conservative plan which the conservatives are now attacking in their amnesia? 

Now, **fortunately, the conservatives at the Heritage Foundation came up with this plan back when political conservatism was still pragmatic, so it will actually be somewhat** (perhaps remarkably) **effective. But the individual mandate is utterly odious and should have been deemed unconstitutional.** My money is going to go to the insurance industry whether I buy insurance or not; When I am fined for not purchasing insurance from one of the several abominable companies offering me insurance plans, that fine money goes into their pockets anyway as compensation for my not buying a plan from them!

That fine is going to be 2.5% of an individual's income. Now, **I refuse to purchase health insurance from insurance companies out of moral principle.** *The same way someone might refuse to buy from Nike for using sweatshops,* refusing to buy bananas because of the oppressive nature of the industry, or buying local instead of shopping at walmart, **I do not wish to participate or contribute to the psychotic, anti-human health insurance industry of any of its scumbag companies.** *What if you were fined for refusing to purchase groceries from a major grocery store? Fined for refusing to drive a car?* 

How much better would it be if that 2.5% income tax went straight into a single payer system like a combo between the VA and medicare/medicaid? **But as it is, this is one of the most regressive taxes ever.** *It's more regressive than the flat tax.* The wealthy will be buying health insurance for far less than 2.5% of their income, whereas the poor and ""middle class"" will be either paying about that or more than 2.5% for their plans (or be paying the fine, but getting no benefit in return).

Lessig would revolutionize and open  up the internet for the future and pass The Citizens Equality Act of 2017

>It changes the way we fund campaigns, ends gerrymandering, and protects the right of all citizens to vote.

>These reforms will give us — finally — what we were promised: a government of, by, and for the people.

 Lessig has met the polling requirements for the next Democrat Presidential debate but has been denied admittances Democrstic Party insiders change debate admittance rules to exclude him.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig

Lessig is a candidate for the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Lessig is a proponent of reduced legal restrictions on copyright, trademark, and radio frequency spectrum, particularly in technology applications. In 2001, he founded Creative Commons, a non-profit organization devoted to expanding the range of creative works available for others to build upon and to share legally. Prior to his most recent appointment at Harvard, he was a professor of law at Stanford Law School, where he founded the Center for Internet and Society, and at the University of Chicago. He is a former board member of the Free Software Foundation and Software Freedom Law Center; the Washington, D.C. lobbying groups Public Knowledge and Free Press; and the Electronic Frontier Foundation.[2]
As a political activist, Lessig has called for state-based activism to promote substantive reform of government with a Second Constitutional Convention.[3] In May 2014, he launched a crowd-funded political action committee which he termed Mayday PAC with the purpose of electing candidates to Congress who would pass campaign finance reform.[4] Lessig is also the co-founder of Rootstrikers, and is on the boards of MapLight and Represent.us.[5] He serves on the advisory boards of the Democracy Café[6] and the Sunlight Foundation.[7]

Then the Hillary campaign insiders changed the rules

> As CNN specified in a late September memo, to qualify a candidate had to poll at 1 percent in the ""polls released between August 1, 2015 and October 10, 2015."" The first debate was October 12.

>So, we believed we had our guidelines. And as such, we worked hard--and spent our campaign's resources--to meet this clarified goal. It wasn't easy, as most of the national polls didn't even include Lessig's name. But then a week ago, a Monmouth poll of Democrats nationally found him at the qualifying percentage. Then an NBC poll found the same. HuffPost Pollster now lists three polls at 1%. Since the Monmouth poll, no poll that included Lessig's name found him with anything less than 1%.

>But apparently it did not matter. Late last week, the DNC again changed the rules for participation in the debates. Just at the point that it seemed Lessig was about to get in, the DNC has shut the door.

>We were informed of this change in a phone call late last week that I had with the DNC political director. During that call, I was told that the DNC participation standard for the debates was for a candidate to be at one percent in three polls conducted, ""six weeks prior to the debate""--not the clarified rule cited earlier by Wasserman-Shultz and the DNC political director that a candidate had to be at one percent in three polls conducted ""in the six weeks prior to the debate.""

"Why medical costs will really skyrocket now: Under Obamacare all health insurance companies now want medical costs to rise as much as possible over time so their actual profits go up because they are all now ""cost plus' providers",2,3otkdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3otkdg/why_medical_costs_will_really_skyrocket_now_under/,0,1444914632.0,"Why your medical costs will really skyrocket now.

Under Obamacare all health insurance companies now want medical costs to rise as much as possible over time so their actual profits go up because they are all now ""cost plus' providers.

Let me explain.

The health insuramce companies in the USA under obamacare or the Affordable Care Act are now allowed to charge only 25%-20% more in premiums than they pay out. This is called a MLR or Medical Loss Ratio.

 It was supposed to limit profits health insurance companies made. 

 Instead it turns them all into ""cost plus"" contractors who all now WANT healthcare costs to rise as much as possible over the years so they can charge you higher premiums so that 20% profit is a lot more real money.

(I am amazed this isnt discussed all the time. I have NEVER heard it discussed. I don't think the providers or the health insurers WANT it discussed. would you?).

  As a result in order to make their profits higher health carecosts must be HIGHER. So health insurance companies are all now ""cost plus"" companies and want health care costs to be as high as possible. If average hospital costs per appendectomy rise 50% next year  then health insurance companies  will ne able to charge premiums 50% higher and their 20% profit margin will be much much higher in total dollar profits.

So ironically the health insurance companies  that used to try to keep health care costs down now ALSO want them to rise as much as possible over the years. Theymight lose a little more this year but next year they make a LOT more. And of course hospital companies and providers want to  raise them as much as possible. So now EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU THE PATIENT wants medical care costs to rise as much as possible.  

And because there is little competition between health insurance companies to keep your premiums low because now YOU MUST PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE BY LAW health insurance premiums are rising 40% and 50% per year. So guess what ? The health insurance companies will charge 20% on top of that increase and their profits will go much higher every year costs go up!  The6 would love it if every appendectomy in the USA cost $1 million dollars next year.

When your contract states you can charge a percentage of the cost its called a ""cost plus""contract. Suddenly you want all costs to be as high as possible. It is ""cost plus"" governent contracts in the defense industry that led to $500 hammers.  Now instead of hammers, its medical procedures which already start at $50,000 so you can imagine how bad this will be in a few years unless something is done.

No good business person EVER wants their providers to have cost plus contracts. EVER.

But that is in the past.

The question is how do we fix it?

You have probably experienced the total financial rape that the US medical esrablishment does because no one limits them.

In most countries the government limits what doctors and hospitals can charge by procedure. Since they know what tue average is they know what they should cost. This means all providers like hospitals have an incentive to figure out ways to deliver medicine cheaper because that is the only way they can increase profits. And they have to stay high quality or they are cut from the program completely and cant practice medicine at all.

In japan for example doctors and hospitals are limited by law how much they can charge. Docotrs for example can only chargeso much per stitch for cuts. As a result they must find ways to do things cheaper to make profit. As a result a Japan developed the least expensive MRI  machine inthe wordl which costs $2000 FOR THE WHOLE MACHINE NOT PER TREATMENT.  (That machine is of course banned in the usa.)

So we need to switch to government price limits quickly and our medical costs will come down. Insurance comaonies wont be happy of course becuase that means their 20%surcharg ewill be much smaller but you will be happier as your helath insurance costs fall.

The usa government already knows what procedures shpuld cost and limits them for medicare. If you have a parent on medicare you know how wonderful their treatment is and howsmotthly it all works. So this isnt hard to do. In  fact the us governme t already does it!

So we need to drastically change Obamacare . The easiest thing would be to allow everyone to go into the medicare program. Their premiums would be much lower .You dont have to reregulate the obamacare system becuase all patients would quickly abandon it.",Progressive,0

It is beholden to moneyed special interests and advances the interests of lobbyists.  It spies on its own citizens and foreign governments.  It perpetuates a serious mass incarceration problem.  It errs on the side of restricting civil liberties rather than protecting them.  So why do these same progressives think the federal government can be trusted to regulate gun ownership when similar efforts - namely, the War on Drugs - have been such massive failures?  Why do progressives still trust big government solutions to any problem, for the matter, if they acknowledge that the federal government has become so hopelessly corrupt?

I consider myself left-of-center politically.  I agree with progressives on many issues.  But when it comes to civil liberties, I think the libertarians are far more forceful and consistent.

"(throwaway) Progressives of Reddit, I'm finding myself increasingly racist/resentful of black people. I've always been open-minded and I'm actively looking for ways to change my perceptions. Hatred does not dwell well within me. Story inside.",1,1c86id,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/1c86id/throwaway_progressives_of_reddit_im_finding/,5,1365825226.0,"Before I explain myself, do understand that any comments castigating me as a racist or insults in my direction will be of no use- I'm not proud of my feelings and I'm actively looking to change them. I've always considered myself an open-minded person- liberal even- grounded in science and academia (currently getting an application for med school in order).

I grew up in a predominantly white town in southern california- population around 120,000. Violent crime simply did not exist. No murders. No rapes. Life was good. In fact, my hometown was named America's safest city once when I was a young lad. My dad owns a lackluster shoe store. My mom is a receptionist at a dentist's office. We are pretty poor. Neither of my parents attended college. Nonetheless, I was lucky enough to attend an Ivy League school for undergrad (after 2 years at a community college) and I'm currently applying to some of the top med schools in the country. I share these facts to hopefully emphasize the point that I am not some rich white individual who was born with a golden spoon in my mouth. I worked exceedingly hard to get where I am today and I'm a pretty logical person.

Nonetheless, following my graduation from college I moved to Los Angeles. A shitty part of Los Angeles. This is where my resentment towards black individuals first began. Literally almost everyday I would get verbally abused by black individuals in the street. ""Look at this fucking white boy."" ""I'll fuck this nigga up."" ""Who da fuq are who? Fucking white boy."" Blah Blah Bla. These odd verbal attacks occurred as I simply minded my own business, just trying to get to my own apartment building. These random outbursts were 100% unprovoked each time. Even worse were the cat calls directed at my girlfriend. These people would say some of the grossest fucking shit I've ever heard. They would yell it from their cars sometimes. Black dick this... Fuck that ass that...Mmmm gurllll. If my girlfriend ever retorted, she would actually get called a racist by these people? This is still a concept that seems pretty fucking stupid to me.

In any case, after a few months in LA I finally got mugged by a black person. Knife point. Luckily I was alone (sans the girlfriend). Took $60 dollars from my wallet. Luckily he didn't realize I had my Iphone in my pocket/didn't want it.

At this point I was feeling pretty fucking shitty about where I was living but I didn't have the funds to move elsewhere and I liked the research position I had landed at USC far too much. Life went on this way for awhile. I started to notice black people on the streets everywhere I went around town. On Tuesday afternoons, for example, there would be groups of black men just crowding around alleys or someone's doorway. Always. I became attentive to other minorities- hispanics and asians- and these individuals typically seemed to be working somewhere. Black individuals, however, always seemed to just be hanging around neighborhoods. I began to notice differences for the first time.

5 months after my first mugging, my friend and I were mugged again by THREE black individuals. This time at gun point. Gun was at my friends head. Again, took both our wallets and our phones and my friend's watch.

I finally moved. This time I found myself in Chicago (I know- not exactly the safest city either). I was never mugged in Chicago but some of the shit I was while on public transportation blew my mind. It was ALWAYS caused by black people. The SMALLEST thing would set these people off like a fucking gallon of gasoline. The rage in these people on the bus, this apparent lack of self-control really affected my perceptions. I saw so many fights, so much pathetic gangster talk and so much bullshit.

I am currently still living in Chicago and the same shit goes on- I am often hollered at as I mind my own business- I still always see black people just hanging around during working hours. I still see girls constantly getting cat called on the bus/street.

In the past months I have started looking up things online- statistics, videos, articles etc. all detailing black crime. I'm sure I don't need to enlighten anyone but the numbers are fucking appalling. Blacks outnumber everyone in violent crime by such a significant margin it blows my mind. I know poverty is often cited as the explanatory variable here, but there are twice as many poor white individuals as poor black individuals in this country- without a fraction of the violent crime. The Atlanta PD recently put out stats citing that 95% of all rapes in the city were caused by blacks- although they make up 54% of the population. Numbers were equally as high for other types of crimes. Welfare recipients are overwhelmingly black. Even legitimate scientific articles in psychology (http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf) have mentioned that social factors do not account for the variance in some attributes of black individuals. I have seen some shit, Reddit, that paints the average black person in a horrible light- and i don't know how to un-see it. I recently spoke to my close friend currently in Paris and she tells me that the French are having their own terrible time with black people and individuals are growing increasingly aggravated about the black crime in that country. I've seen similar storys in London and Scandinavia.

Now, I know not ALL black people are like this, of course. My good friend from college was black (although adopted by white parents, oddly enough) and he was a fantastic and brilliant human being. I have met other black people with similarly sterling qualities. Yet, 95% of black people that I encounter fucking suck. I have come to fucking detest the gangster culture and I have realized that stereotypes are fucking realities.

I want to change my perceptions. I liked being my old liberal self. Hatred does not meld well within me. What can I do, Reddit?

Basically, this: I know for a fact that

* I don't really pay that much attention to the drones stuff. I think they're terrifying and a symbol of the insanity that is war in 2013, but... I'm not outraged by them. The thing that's made me pay most attention to them is Homeland and that's initially because I've loved Claire Danes ever since I was 15. If it was Bush droning people into the ground I would be outraged. I think I know why and I know how I would vote on drone issues.

* I have had to stop paying attention to gun news and gun control discussions entirely. I cannot stop myself from empathizing with one of the fathers who lost a child at Newtown and I wish no one had guns. I will never ever vote to take yours away and I know that the idea of an ""assault"" weapon is nonsensical and my father hunts every fall with his rifles. But he's also had a gun stolen from him that was used later in a fatal robbery attempt (my dad's gun was used by the perpetrator who was killed, so my dad'd handgun didn't kill anyone), and this bothers me and I want to point out to every gun owner that they have in their power to effortlessly kill another human being with a legal tool that was designed for that very purpose, and I want to rage.

Basically, I'm not responding viscerally enough to the drone attacks if i were solely responding based on my own convictions, and yet I'm responding way outside my logical comfort zone regarding gun control and in my deep-down soul want guns just gone, gone, gone. 

These are insane ways of thinking not only because they are inconsistent with each other but also because they are politically untenable ideas that I would never imagine a sane, electable politician to agree with me on.

I think the drones thing makes me more empathetic to conservatives who seem so hypocritical to me: how can you be a Christian and vote shamelessly for a warmonger like Bush and Cheney and their crew? And yet here I am, knowing in my head that logically the drone strikes are inhumane, error-prone, and that if Halliburton made them while Cheney was in office, I'd be furious; now I'm merely annoyed and wish we'd stop using them. I think this stems from a few places:

* I voted for Obama and I don't want to be disappointed in that choice, although anyone who thinks we'd be droneless under Romney or (lol) Ron Paul is deluding themselves as much as I am.
* I was ultimately a Clinton supporter in the primaries and I knew Obama was a flawed choice well before Election Day, and to be totally honest never expected perfection from the guy. Drones sort of fit within my margin of error at the moment. It's heartless and I'm not sure how to square it up with the bleeding heart liberal thing about guns.

As far as guns go, totally opposite direction into crazy town. I fantasize about there never being a second amendment , about any guns never being legal, and when I'm really high, never being invented. My dad hunts deer and had an elk on his wall and yet I don't think he should have a right to own the death devices he does. But I'll never say that and I'll never ever vote to have then taken away, I just wish I think that my more moderate friends (which in America on this issue is basically everyone, it's only my international coworkers who are fully on my side re: guns) could stand to listen to some counter arguments instead of stocking up their basements at the first sounds of gun control legislation. 

So, what do you think? Am I as bad as everyone on /r/politics would say I am, and to my crazier throwaways they've told me directly I am? Am I a hopeless  bleeding heart hippie denying the truth of a harsh human reality to fit my own cushy lifestyle? How do I rectify this?",Progressive,0

I've always believed Americans should vote for whomever they like best--Republicans, Greens, whatever--because voting from fear isn't noble and it's contrary to our best interests in the long term. Moreover, even GOP candidates I've disagreed with have never seemed inherently dangerous. Most politicians--especially those running for president--have big egos, but most also are humans and seem like they like the country we call home.

But none of this is true anymore. It's clear to anyone who is objective that Trump is a liar and he's an egomaniac. These things combined make him dangerous, and when you factor in his ignorance of foreign and domestic policy, it's clear the only reason he's running is ... so he can say he's president. 

Look at this another way: I have posted in the past and told friends I believed Ted Cruz would be a more regressive president than Trump. I still believe this, and I believe it because Cruz has more or less stuck to the same basic conservative principals throughout his political. Meanwhile, it's obvious that Trump will say anything to anyone on any day and what he says will have little to do with what he's said in the past. His views change to the point of outright contradiction with alarming rapidity and the only thing we can be sure about is, he doesn't care about anything but winning for the sake of winning. 

In short, he is truly and deeply dangerous. He should not have been nominated but he cannot be president. This man is insane. 

So, please, if you live in Florida or Ohio or any other battleground state, please, please just vote for Hillary. ",Progressive,0

Especially now, with his signing of NDAA and his probable signing of SOPA into law, I began to think of alternatives, and one came to me.

If Ron Paul were to be elected, almost all of the things he would have any real and immediate control over would fall on the side of the liberal agenda. Drug enforcement, civil liberties, military actions in other countries,etc.

In addition, the guy doesn't play games. He follows a strict set of ethics and never deviates. Sometimes, that might mean something we don't like, buy at least we would know what we were getting into. With Obama, I'm severely in doubt of every word that leaves his mouth nowadays.
 
There is a small possibility of him being able to elect a supreme court justice; however, most of them are in good health and none of them (to my knowledge) have any plans of stepping down. 

Would it be so bad to have a Democratic House and Senate, with a libertarian as president?

I am a PhD student studying media portrayals of Latin America, and I can honestly say, Venezuela may be the most misrepresented country in the press. 

I don't want you to just believe me. I have given you links so you can scrutinize my argument fully. Check up on me. Am I making this stuff up or exaggerating? Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable sources of primary data, such as the World Bank, the United Nations and highly reputable polling organizations like Pew and Latinobarmetro, which is a Chilean polling organization whose work features regularly in the Economist, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Let's get mythbusting!

**The Accusation** Chavez led a coup. It is often remarked that Chavez led a coup in 1992. Two example is [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html) New York Times article and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/key-events-in-hugo-chavezs-rise-to-power-and-presidency-in-venezuela/2013/03/05/8a4dddcc-85e1-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html) Washington Post article. Conveniently, the context of the coup is left out. Despite producing more the $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, the equivalent of 20 Marshall Plans, the majority of Venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were  below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970 and 1997, workers' incomes declined by [50%, while poverty doubled between 1984 and 1991](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040274?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101776675521)

President Carlos Andres Perez, on orders from the IMF, increased oil prices for Venezuelans. This led to increases in transport costs, to the point where Caracas residents were spending, on average, 25% of their entire wages on bus fares.  (Jones, B. [“Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) p. 116) Food riots broke out and Perez sent the army in. 3 days of terror ensued. The LA Times' Bart Jones speaks of Red Cross workers being gunned down in the street, “mass graves” being filled with “mutilated corpses”, “tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of their heads” and children being gunned down as the armies fired indiscriminately into shanty towns. (Jones, B. [Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) pp.121-124) Much of the army leadership was deeply shocked at this. They began to gather around a young Colonel called Hugo Chavez and conspired to rebel against the President. The rebellion of 1992 failed, and Chavez was sentenced to what amounted to a life sentence, yet, the rebellion was so popular with the public that the new president, Rafael Caldera was essentially forced to release Chavez just 2 years later. After getting out he immediately began to organize for a Presidential election.

**Myth: Partially confirmed**

Myth 2- The Venezuelan economy is a shambles. In [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-oil-giants-squeeze-chavez) Guardian article, the author wonder how long the Venezuelan economy can totter on. Figures from the World Bank, hardly a Chavez ally, show a different story. Venezuela's GDP has [more than tripled under Chavez,](http://i.imgur.com/CyeLEvC.jpg) while net national income [has also nearly tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/gKd5YBs.jpg) Meanwhile, both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment has dropped from over 11% to under 8%. When asked themselves, Venezuelans have the [highest confidence in their economy of any Latin American country.](http://i.imgur.com/QtZ7L3x.jpg) Venezuela's external debt has [dropped precipitously.](http://i.imgur.com/rJSNmaS.jpg) Meanwhile, Venezuela's stock market is the [best-performing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) in the [world.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) You may have heard stupid Chavez is causing massive inflation, [but the facts are the opposite](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg). One year before Chavez took office, inflation was an eye-watering 103%. It is now in the teens. The high-point inflation under Chavez was lower than the lowest inflation under the previous 2 presidents. 

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Chavez is a dictator**
This one is so ubiquitous I won't give examples. 

Voter turnout in Venezuela in the October 2012 election was above [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012), higher than any election in US history. Under Chavez, voter turnout in Venezuelan elections has increased by 135% (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout:[14.8 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012). That means almost two and a half times as many people vote nowadays than in the 1990s. The number of registered voter has risen by over 70% under Chavez.

Jimmy carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, saying [“the system developed in Venezuela is probably the most advanced in the world to date”](http://embavenez-uk.org/pdf/fs_democracia.pdf) The number of polling stations has increased by [38% in 10 years.](http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf) One year pre-Chavez, only [11% of Venezuelans](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) believed elections were clean.

Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy from [1-10](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) How does Chavez do it, it must be because...

**Myth: Chavez Controls the Media** There appears to be an authoritarian dictator crushing freedom of the press in Venezuela. We read about it all the time. How many free outlets are left?

As Mark Weisbrot has shown in an extensive study, the Venezuelan state owns [about 5% of all media outlets.](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf) Both the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19368807) and [Le Monde](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) agree on the 5% figure. For comparison, state-owned media account for 40 and 37% of British and  French TV. 9 out of the top 10 selling newspapers in Venezuela are virulent anti-Chavez, and by virulent, Le Monde Diplo calls it [“hate media”](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) while Richard Gott in the Guardian says the largest station, RCTV is a [“white supremacist channel”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jun/07/comment.venezuela) and JMH Salas reports that they regularly assault him with words like [“sambo, thick-lipped monkey” “ape”](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040277?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101777011571) (Chavez is the first-non white President) In contrast to what we read, Venezuelans believe there's [about as much freedom of speech as there is in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg) **Myth: Busted**

**Myth: There are food shortages in Venezuela**

Actually, venezuela has [doubled the amount of cereals it produces](http://i.imgur.com/qPybLCY.jpg) in just 10 years, [as have milk, eggs and pork](http://imgur.com/agUo7ym). Child malnutrition has dropped by [2/3 in 10 years](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg), too. So, are there food shortages? Look at this [anti-Chavez blogger's post.](http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/food-shortages-in-venezuela.html) He shows that food shortages mean the most popular mayonnaise is gone, but there are clearly 4 or 5 other brands still available. Again, white sugar is gone but there is plenty of brown left. Only one brand of powdered milk is left. The reason for this is Chavez instituted price-controls and gave people jobs, increasing their purchasing power. This meant for the first time in their lives, ordinary people can afford dairy produce. If you think about the logic behind this, you can find out a lot about how the media see ordinary people. In the 1990s when children were dying from malnutrition, there were no stories of food shortages, but now that rich people like themselves can't find Kraft mayonnaise and have to settle for Hellmans, that is a shortage. **Myth: Busted**

**Myth:** Venezuela is the most dangerous place in the world

There can be no doubt that there are many murders in Venezuela, as this chart of [reported homicides shows.](http://i.imgur.com/0j1zklT.jpg). Those claiming crime was the country's major problem increased from less than [1% in 2001](http://imgur.com/2npBf1b) to [65% in 2010](http://imgur.com/kk2DuUN). And yet, when asked whether they or their family were victims of crime, “yes” dropped from [49% in 2000](http://i.imgur.com/SRufLZk.jpg) to [28% 2010](http://i.imgur.com/3u0luhO.jpg). Your chances of being a victim of crime have dropped by half while your fear of crime has spiked 6500%, which leads me to believe it is a media circus. Several writers have pointed to an orchestrated campaign by the media to focus on crime, and not the progress Venezuela has made. 

**Myth: Partially Busted**

**Myth Hugo Chavez is anti-semitic**

The entire case for this comes from a quote where Chavez spoke ill of “those who crucified Jesus”. When read in context, it cannot be taken as such. He gave a list of traitors. He mentioned those who doubled-crossed Simon Bolivar, those who crucified Jesus, those who betrayed Che Guevara, etc. [Here's a pic](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5645) of Chavez meeting the leading Rabbi in venezuela. I might add that this is common tactic of the US elite. A New York Times search for [“Nicaragua anti-semitism”](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/anti-semitism+nicaragua/) shows no hits for 130 years, a slew of stories between 1983-1986, when the left-wing Sandinistas were in charge, then nothing for 25 years.

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Hugo Chavez loves dictators like Saddam and Ahmadinejad .**

Most of the reports of this come from the time when Chavez went on a whistle-stop tour of the oil-producing countries. The day after he met Ahmadinejad, he actually met a dictator with a far worse human rights record. [That person was US-favorite, the King of Saudi Arabia.](http://www.images22.com/pics/04/saudi-arabias-king-abdullah-with-hugo-chavez.jpg) The picture elicited almost no response in the US media whatsoever. Chavez has taken a lead in reinvigorating the OPEC cartel, and his visits were laying the groundwork for an agreed reduction in oil drilling, in order to stabilize prices. 

**Myth: Busted**
**Myth: Chavez is an Isolated, Unpopular Leader**

Chavez was the first President of the [Pink Tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_tide), who see themselves as left-leaning, anti-imperialist politicians. President Lula of Brazil openly backed Chavez, saying [""A victory for Chávez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America … this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.""](www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy). President Correa of Ecuador has called Chavez “a guiding light”( Jones, B. “Hugo” p.420) [Here's a pic](http://paginadoenock.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kirchner-Evo-Lula-Chavez.jpg) of the Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina with Chavez, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/iaubmdb.jpg) what the Argentine public think of him. When asked which country they admired the most, Latin Americans chose [Venezuela by a considerable margin.](http://i.imgur.com/nOaLC5T.png)

**Myth: Busted**

**Bonus Myth: The People are worse off under Chavez**

Chavez instituted a national healthcare system which had performed 225 million consultations by 2007 alone. (Cannon, B.  Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93) The number of public doctors has increased by 1200%, from 1628 to 19571 by 2007. 50,000 Venezuelans were given free operations to restore their sight, between 1 and 1.5 million were taught to read for the first time (Jones p. 8) Health expenditure per person [has tripled](http://i.imgur.com/PriJgse.jpg) According to the Gini coefficient, venezuela went from the most unequal country in Latin America to the most equal. An AC Nielsen/Datos report showed that, from 2004-2006, [97.6% of the population grew in income.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2794)

As a student of Latin America, I think Venezuela is one of the most vibrant democracies on Earth, yet the media is representing it as a hellhole. Why is this? [Many](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/201312912275351687.html) have [wondered](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hugo-chavez-proves-you-can-lead-a-progressive-popular-government-that-says-no-to-neoliberalism-8202738.html) Some say it can be explained with [Chomsky and Hermann's Propaganda Model](http://southoftheborderdoc.com/media-distortions-in-latin-america/)

For me, I think it is because they're scared. Of you.  They're scared if people in America knew the truth about what can be achieved in a small country, there would be a dramatic change in American politics overnight. 


Venezuela is certainly not an ideal society by any means, and I'm not even much of a Chavez supporter, but it saddens me to see so many derogatory remarks made about someone who spearheaded change which the vast majority wanted. It also clouds real debate over his failings, as people like me are forced to spend their time correcting and replying to nonsense accusations.

Acting as though she hasn't been in favor of a proposal that was being crafted while she was Secretary of State doesn't wash. But this latest announcement has less to do with Clinton/Sanders than with Clinton/Trumpka. Clinton wants the AFL-CIO endorsement.


While the Sanders campaign has concentrated on getting votes, the Clinton forces have targeted endorsements. They may have other thumbscrews on Trumpka and the TPP swing is just to provide him cover. Or they may just think he's an idiot who won't recognize the ploy. We'll have to see.


What is clear, however, is that Clinton thinks it's worth further alienating Obama to get the Trumpka stamp of approval. She may have thought her wishy washy withdrawal of support for the Keystone Pipeline would have little impact on her relationship with Obama, but the TPP announcement definitely takes her off his Christmas card list.


Sanders has been against the TPP and Keystone all along, but those are the sorts of policy disagreements Obama understands - and respects. Obama has no animosity for Sanders, and to think Obama might not have a big influence on this campaign is a disconnect from reality. It would be the height of irony for Obama to beat Clinton out of the presidency for a second time.

—Barack Obama, 2009 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY-7fZ-RX3A))

# TL;DR:


1. The Postal Service processes almost half a billion pieces of mail each day. The anticipated volume of mail-in ballots amount to a fraction of the total volume USPS will deal with over the next two months.
2. The Postal Service has longstanding financial difficulties, but has enough cash on hand to continue operations until October 2021 at current rates, even without tapping a $10 billion line of credit provided by the CARES Act.
3. The Postal Service has been removing under-performing blue mailboxes for decades in response to declining use, including more than 14,000 removed under the Obama Administration. 
4. The Postal Service has been consolidating processing centers and re-orienting operations within processing centers for years in response to declining letter mail volume and increasing package volume.
5. FedEx and other parcel delivery services are also suffering delivery delays amid the coronavirus pandemic. Delays are not unique to USPS.
6. Much has been made of the Postal Service's letter to states encouraging them to send ballots to voters 14 days before Election Day. However, identical recommendations were sent even before DeJoy took over as Postmaster General. Further, the co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections (a Democrat) made the same recommendation.

# Will the Postal Service be able to handle all of the mailed-in ballots this November?


First, let's set some context: the Postal Service [processes](https://facts.usps.com/one-day/#:~:text=The%20Postal%20Service%20processes%20and%20delivers%20472.1%20million%20mail%20pieces%20each%20day) 472 million pieces of mail each day. In the 2016 presidential election, 138 million people voted. [According](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/politics/absentee-voting-analysis/index.html) to CNN, voters will begin receiving absentee ballots as early as September 4. This means that even if every single voter mailed their ballot in over the course of those two months, it would amount to a drop in the ocean compared to the total amount of mail USPS will process during that period.

# Is the Postal Service being underfunded to sabotage the election?


Obviously, the Postal Service has significant [longstanding](https://ips-dc.org/how-congress-manufactured-a-postal-crisis-and-how-to-fix-it/) financial difficulties dating back decades, largely due to Congressional mismanagement. The immediate question is, however, is the Postal Service being sabotaged or otherwise undermined to affect the election. In a word: no.

The Postal Service has **more cash on hand than it had before the pandemic**, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/) to the Washington Post:

>At the start of the pandemic, the Postal Service had $9.2 billion in cash, roughly two months of pay for its 630,000 workers. It now has $13.4 billion in cash after tapping a separate $3.4 billion loan from Treasury.

In fact, this is more cash on hand than the USPS has ever had.

In addition, the CARES Act, which Trump signed into law earlier this year, [provides](https://about.usps.com/newsroom/national-releases/2020/0729-treasury-agreement-statement.htm) an **additional $10 billion line of credit** to the USPS, should it need it:

>United States Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced today that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of the Treasury on the terms and conditions associated with $10 billion lending authority provided in the CARES Act.  The USPS Board of Governors unanimously approved the agreement in principle yesterday and expects that the parties will formally memorialize the agreement through loan documents that will be jointly developed over the coming weeks.

Further, [according](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/25/postal-service-packages-coronavirus/) to the Washington Post, the pandemic has actually improved the finances of the Postal Service, not deteriorated them, due to increased e-commerce shipping:

>A tidal wave of packages is keeping the U.S. Postal Service afloat during the coronavirus recession, boosting the beleaguered agency’s finances to near pre-pandemic levels...  


>Week to week, package deliveries increased 20 to 50 percent in April compared with the year-ago period, and 60 to 80 percent in May.

As a result, **the Postal Service has enough money to continue operations well past the election, through March 2021 at the worst and October 2021 at the best, without even accessing the Treasury's $10 billion line of credit**:

>If package volumes persist at 15 to 20 percent above normal levels in the coming months and the Postal Service does not do any more borrowing, it will delay its solvency crisis until October 2021. But if package volumes return to pre-pandemic levels, the agency is set to run out of cash by March. Accessing the $10 billion loan from Treasury would put off insolvency even further.

In short, there is no imminent danger that the Postal Service will run out of money prior to the election.

# What about them taking away the blue mailboxes?


The Washington Post [covered](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2009/07/24/ST2009072403875.html?sid=ST2009072403875) the declining use of public mailboxes in **2009**:

>...half of the blue boxes in the Washington area have disappeared in the last nine years, and 200,000 nationwide have been plucked up in the last 20 years, leaving 175,000 total.  


>The U.S. Postal Service says it removes ""underperforming"" mailboxes -- those that collect fewer than 25 pieces of mail a day -- after a week-long ""density test."" Snail mail is a dying enterprise because Americans increasingly pay bills online, send Evites for parties and text or give a quick call on a cellphone rather than write a letter.

In addition, the Obama-appointed USPS Inspector General [noted](https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/mail-collection-box-%E2%80%94-management-service-status) in **2016** that this process continued under the Obama Administration and is based on usage data:

>Nationwide, there were about 153,000 collection boxes at the end of fiscal year (FY) 2016; however, the U.S. Postal Service has been removing underused boxes, with about 14,000 boxes removed over the past five years. Postal Service policy requires approval by the Area and public notification in order to permanently remove a collection box.

Separately, since **2016**, USPS has been [removing](https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/local/2019/04/04/u-s-postal-service-installing-new-mailboxes-combat-mail-fishing/3346179002/) older model blue mailboxes and replacing them with new ones that prevent mail fishing (where a perpetrator steals mail from the box):

>Since late 2016, the U.S. Postal Service has been replacing or retrofitting thousands of mailboxes throughout the Northeast to combat a surge in mail theft involving string and glue contraptions.  


>“As the deployment progresses, northern New Jersey consumers will notice a difference with the way mail is deposited into the security enhanced boxes,” said George Flood, a Postal Service spokesman. “The new collection boxes demonstrate our commitment to the safety and security of the mail.”

In short, USPS has been removing or replacing blue mailboxes for over a decade because *nobody uses them anymore* or they need to be replaced with more secure ones. It's not a conspiracy. It's standard practice based on usage and theft data.

# What about them removing mail sorting machines and closing processing centers?


As the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/politics/postal-service-to-consolidate-48-processing-centers-in-coming-months.html) and [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/federal-eye/post/postal-service-set-to-announce-facility-closures/2012/02/22/gIQApEluTR_blog.html) reported, the Postal Service has been consolidating processing centers since at least **2012**, moving to centralized processing as a way to drive efficiencies in response to declining mail volume:

>The United States Postal Service announced Thursday \[February 23, 2012\] that it would begin consolidating 48 mail processing centers beginning in July, the first phase of a cost-cutting plan that is intended to save the agency nearly $1.2 billion a year as it tries to adjust to declining mail volume.

Likewise, as total volume of mail continues to shift toward packages and away from letter mail, the Postal Service has been re-orienting existing processing centers toward package processing. After publishing an almost conspiratorial article about a mere 19 mail sorting machines being removed from five processing centers, Vice [edited](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election) its article to append this more plausible explanation:

>Most of the machines being dismantled in the facilities Motherboard identified are delivery bar code sorters (DBCS), into which letters, postcards and similarly sized mail (but not magazines and large envelopes, which are categorized as “flats” and sorted differently) are fed.  


>After publication, USPS spokesperson David Partenheimer told Motherboard, “The Postal Service routinely moves equipment around its network as necessary to match changing mail and package volumes. Package volume is up, but mail volume continues to decline. Adapting our processing infrastructure to the current volumes will ensure more efficient, cost effective operations and better service for our customers.”  


>Marketing mail is down more than 15 percent through June of this year compared to last year. While this is a much steeper drop than recent years, it is **continuing a decade-long trend of mail volume decline for everything but packages. In other words, DBCSs have less mail to sort than they ever have before and it’s far from clear how much of that mail is ever coming back. So it stands to reason the USPS might not need as many of them.**  


>The postal workers interviewed by Motherboard understood this, and in some cases even made the argument some DBCS machines might be of better use at other facilities.

In fact, just because a mail sorting machine is removed from one processing center doesn't mean it wont be used elsewhere, as even CNN [admitted](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/16/politics/usps-documents-sorting-machine-removal-order/index.html):

>CNN has previously reported that union officials had said the destination of each removed machine varies. Some are scrapped entirely while some are transferred to other facilities.

[According](https://www.wnep.com/article/news/nation-world/mail-sorting-machines-removed/507-8c96ed32-3b5a-45ac-9d03-e6cd3f971739) to the Postal Service, many of the letter sorting machines are being replaced with newer, more efficient machines (i.e. that require fewer workers to operate) as part of a multi-year effort to better accommodate increasing package volume:

>\[W\]e are retiring older, out of date equipment so that we can expand our newer sorting equipment that can handle as many as 30,000 letters an hour. This will increase our capacity and our efficiency to handle increased package volume as well as any current letter and flat volume. This is a multi-year effort that prepares us for the future.

# What about recent mail delays?


First, it's important to note that mail delays are nothing new, as NPR [notes](https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902604303/postal-delays-errors-in-swing-states-loom-over-election):

>Any other year, a steady underperformance of mail delivery in swing states would go unnoticed. This year, though, the delivery rates released Monday have taken on outsized importance: They may foreshadow ballot counting controversies to come.

However, we're in a global pandemic, which is exacerbating problems:

>On-time mail delivery nationally already is suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, presenting a worrisome picture for November as a rapidly rising number of people choose to steer clear of COVID-19 and vote by mail.

Case in point: Fedex, a private company, has been [suffering](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fedex-usa/covid-19-delivery-surge-strains-fedex-service-opening-doors-for-ups-idUSKBN2413GV) from mail delays due to the virus. In no way can this be attributed to sabotage by Trump, as is being implied in discussions of similar delays at USPS:

>While every U.S. package carrier is fighting to manage unexpected demand for home deliveries of bicycles, patio furniture, medicine and food, FedEx entered the pandemic in turnaround mode and is grappling with an inflexible business structure that is contributing to service disruptions in California and Michigan.  


>For two Mondays in a row, FedEx told San Bernardino, California-based Pacific Mountain Logistics it would not make scheduled Ground pickups until Thursday, Chief Executive B.J. Patterson said.  


>The delay is not limited to FedEx’s Ground division that focuses on e-commerce packages. Service at FedEx Express - which caters mostly to business deliveries - also is affected, said Patterson, who has been a FedEx customer for a decade.

Now, it is true that Postmaster General DeJoy's streamlining efforts may result in mail being delayed by a day if there is *already* a delay getting it on the truck, as [noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/07/14/postal-service-trump-dejoy-delay-mail/) by the Washington Post:

>Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told employees to leave mail behind at distribution centers if it delayed letter carriers from their routes, according to internal USPS documents obtained by The Washington Post...  

 
>“If the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day,” according to a document titled, “New PMG’s \[Postmaster General’s\] expectations and plan.” Traditionally, postal workers are trained not to leave letters behind and to make multiple delivery trips to ensure timely distribution of letters and parcels.

However, as alluded to in the document, the purpose of this is to *encourage* workers to meet deadlines, reduce the need for perpetual overtime (a significant driver of costs), and ultimately make the Postal Service *more* efficient. One can't on the one hand decry the poor financial state of the self-sufficient USPS and, at the same time, criticize good faith efforts to improve its operational efficiency and financial health.

# What about that letter USPS sent warning states it may not be able to deliver ballots in time?


CNN, Washington Post, and others have used these notices as proof that Postmaster General DeJoy's reforms to the Postal Service are designed to disenfranchise voters. The problem, as the Wall Street Journal [notes](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-postal-services-good-election-advice-11597606836), is that these notices predate DeJoy's tenure as Postmaster General:

>In reality, it’s closer to the opposite: an attempt by the USPS to forestall state election failure. The letters were planned before the new Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, took the reins on June 15. [USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall] sent nearly identical advice to election officials in a May letter posted at USPS.com. Strange public conspiracy.


>“To account for delivery standards and to allow for contingencies (e.g., weather issues or unforeseen events), voters should mail their return ballots at least 1 week prior to the due date,” Mr. Marshall wrote in May. The same rule, he added, should apply to blank ballots: “The Postal Service also recommends that state or local election officials use FirstClass Mail and allow 1 week for delivery to voters.”

Indeed, the Wall Street Journal notes that New York State's own Board of Elections co-chair (and a Democrat) testified that New York should mail ballots to voters sooner, because 7 days isn't enough time for them to be received and returned:

>That seven-day deadline “is unrealistic,” Douglas Kellner, co-chair of the New York State Board of Elections, testified in court last month. The state board has argued for moving it back to 14 days, in line with the USPS suggestion of allowing seven days for delivery each way.

In short, the Postal Service's notice is intended to help ensure more ballots are counted, not the other way around. The Postal Service has given consistent advice for months that states shouldn't wait until the last minute to get ballots in voters' hands.",Conservative,0

Many leftists who repeat this lie haven't even bothered to look up the speech to see what he said. We here in /r/Conservative are not so capricious. Here is the quote from the speech:

>One of my people came up to me and said, “Mr. President, they tried to beat you on Russia, Russia, Russia.” That didn’t work out too well. They couldn’t do it. They tried the impeachment hoax. That was on a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax.

Literally the next thing he said was acknowledging that there were cases, but based on what he said, the Virus itself isn't the hoax, it's the Democrats' tactics. Even the website I pulled the speech from [says](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-charleston-south-carolina-rally-transcript-february-28-2020):

>It’s unclear if he was referring to the virus itself, the politicization of the virus, or the media’s response to the virus.

Snopes, the ""fact checking"" website that is deeply biased against Donald Trump and conservatives [said](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-coronavirus-rally-remark/):

>Despite creating some confusion with his remarks, Trump did not call the coronavirus itself a hoax.

If you spread this lie, you are literally joining in on the actual hoax by spreading lies that Trump said something that he did not say. Leftists are spreading the misinformation and lies, not us.",Conservative,0

And r/topmindsofreddit continues to brigade us. Right now they have 4 posts on their front page targeting us. So clearly the admins have done absolutely nothing. Even when given overwhelming evidence that top minds breaks reddit site wide rules, they choose to sit on their hands. I'm not surprised, this is honestly what I expected. But I'm still disappointed.

Their cowardice is on display in a particular way recently with their use of the epithet/descriptor “nazi” (see any number of podcasts and links for citations). This has been in the mainstream more than usual because of border policies and laws actually being enforced and leftists suddenly remembering that Trump is in power, not Obama. When they use this term and purport to mean it then they’re letting us all know that they’re cowards. 

Why? Because if they really do think that we’re all nazis then they should be moving heaven and earth to stop us. Instead they’re sending out a tweet or two and wearing a pink hat and maybe marching in a protest (none of which is particularly outside of the norm 
of their regular behavior). If they really mean the words that are coming out of their mouths then they would be doing far, far more, just as any right thinking person states when pondering the hypothetical of living under Hitler.",Conservative,0

Many of you might know me from this article that I wrote back in February about being a Democrat for 20 years that went to a Trump rally: [https://gen.medium.com/ive-been-a-democrat-for-20-years-here-s-what-i-experienced-at-trump-s-rally-in-new-hampshire-c69ddaaf6d07](https://gen.medium.com/ive-been-a-democrat-for-20-years-here-s-what-i-experienced-at-trump-s-rally-in-new-hampshire-c69ddaaf6d07)

Since then, I've left the Democrat party to become an independent and have decided to vote for the President in November. Because the left is crazy and I don't want them having power, which they crave so so so desperately.

I'm happy to answer any questions you might have!

"To Everyone Who Thinks Cruz's Vastly Superior Grassroots Support Is ""Unfair"" I Have This Suggestion: Stop Whining, and Get Involved.",17,4e6syn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/4e6syn/to_everyone_who_thinks_cruzs_vastly_superior/,223,1460340048.0,"The complaints I've been seeing lately from Trump fans are insulting, and frankly childish. Here's my take on a few gripes I've been seeing lately.

* **Objection:** Cruz is trying to ""steal"" the election from Trump!  
* **Response:** Trump, despite what he may think, is not ""entitled"" to any delegates anywhere. He signed up to campaign as a republican candidate. No one forced him into that, it was his choice to do so. It is ignorant and foolish of him to suggest that, having pledged to play by the rules and follow the process in this party, he now thinks he is owed something he is not. He's acting like a spoiled brat.  

* **Objection:** Trump has more votes! His nomination is the ""will of the people!""  
* **Response:** There are a ton of things wrong with this assessment. First of all, a mere 10-15% of the population is not ""the people."" Furthermore, Trump was from the beginning a well-known celebrity from a much talked-about reality show, as well as various books and marketing schemes. He had massive name recognition from the start, giving him a peculiar advantage in populism over others more qualified than him. Furthermore, he's received an obscene amount of free media coverage for saying outrageous things. People like him can win a lot of votes just by stirring people up temporarily. The Founders of this nation recognized that people like him would win nominations all the time if he could just get a plurality with tactics like these. As a result, the process was intentionally designed to give _some_ weight to populism, and _some_ weight to intelligent candidates who do the work of researching the process and figuring it all out.  

* **Objection:** Cruz's campaign is making ""shady"" deals behind the scenes to win delegates!  
* **Response:** This demonstrates a grating ignorance of the nomination process. Cruz's campaign has built up an army of volunteers who believe strongly in his message of strong national security, state's rights, smaller federal government, and constitutional liberty. They have sent the emails, written their representatives, made phone calls, and put their valuable time and effort into getting things done in this delegate election and nomination process. It is absolutely ***disgusting*** to say that what those volunteers are doing with all their hard work  is ""shady"", just because they care enough about the nation and conservative values to to play by the rules and put in the effort to see a well-qualified nominee make it through.  

* **Objection:** The primaries and the general should be entirely democratic! This constitutional republic stuff is too complicated!  
* **Response:** My brother calls Trump the ""Taylor Hicks"" of the primaries. Remember him? He was an American Idol contestant with a lot of flash and pizzazz and very little substantive musical talent. He won the popular vote and therefore the contest, and was immediately signed for a record deal as per the contest's victory contract. However, a peculiar thing happened once his contract came up for renewal: the record label dropped him like a bad habit. Why? Because his music sucked, and no one was buying it any more. He had sailed through the contest with wild, flamboyant appeal, but when it came down to it, he couldn't deliver real results. It's the perfect analogy for Trump, and it should give you some clue as to why it takes more than here-and-now popularity to win a nomination.

#If you want different results, you're going to have to become more involved. You're going to have to get to know those dreaded ""politicians"" you claim to hate so much. You're going to have to learn some things about civics, and get educated on the rules of the parties in power. You're going to have to do more than just whine and cry and complain that things are this way. Get back to us once you do. Until then, all I can hear from you is a lot of vapid, childish moaning and groaning that will be rewarded with more strife and division.

**Edit:** I touched on this, but I really want to emphasize something. The volunteers across the country who are helping Cruz win delegates, both bound and unbound, and in states with presidential preference votes and without them, are NOT the ""establishment"", ""elites"", or ""shills"". Those accusations are frankly absurd. These are simply people who are engaged in their communities. Stop denigrating them with these ridiculous labels just because they got off their backsides last year and started making things happen.",Conservative,0
"Reddit has a left-wing terrorist problem: When you are advocating civil war, overthrowing the government, assassinating the President and making common cause with Stalin...you are a terrorist group no matter what you call yourself.",2562,gup7l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/gup7l8/reddit_has_a_leftwing_terrorist_problem_when_you/,918,1591062541.0,"If you are walking down the street in Portland and unrest breaks out and someone pops you in the nose, can they excuse their violence by saying, ""I'm antifa!""  If they popped you in the nose, does that make you a fascist?  This is how antifa wants it.  For too long, reddit has coddled its violent left-wing communities.  It's not The_Donald out there rioting, burning things and shooting people and cops.

And we here on conservative subreddits have watched this happen for so long.  The scumbag left gets its share of tolerance, but the moment a poster here says, ""If someone comes on my property and tries to harm me or my family, I will defend my home and loved ones...""  Someone hits the, ""threatens or harasses"" report reason.  

But today there's a top post on the antifa subreddit.  And it's a hum dinger.  The revolutionary terrorists are mad that the President said that they are terrorists.  And they go on to SHOW us all that they ARE terrorists with ""terrorist privilege"".  

I guess today is ""tolerate a terrorist"" day.  But any further tolerance of this is reddit tolerating terrorists every day.  Well *some* terrorists.

This is a bit of a deep dive and it's a boring effort-post.  It's not a snappy meme or short article about things.  I hope you'll join me as I show you what we are dealing with, because I'm seeing boomer talking heads on TV saying, *""I have no idea where all of these miscreants on the streets came from!""*  That's because they've missed all the slicey boi Robespierre wannabes that have been calling for blood running down the streets of the USA for YEARS now.  That's right, that Dew-swilling, tendie muncher who used to satisfy him/herself by snidely typing ""America delenda est"" on the internet and using the Red World mod while playing Kaiserreich is on the streets now.

And they WANT you to know who they are all while recoiling that the President said that they are a terrorist group.  The left was VERY KEEN to have the DOJ investigating ""right-wing terror"" in the USA.  They assured us that it's the only **legit** terror in the USA.  Otherwise why would the DOJ be investigating it?  Well, it's time for the spotlight of justice to shine on these left-wingers who want communist revolution and destruction.  Fair's fair, Che.  Time to pay attention to the psychos behind the soy curtain.

Let's look first at [the original post on the antifa subreddit.](https://imgur.com/a/ohUdMfg)

>I am an academic who teaches and studies the rise and fall of Fascism. I am literally anti-fascist by trade. 

Argument from authority.  ""Guys, I literally teach this stuff!""  Yes, Karl, no one's shocked that academia is full of leftism.  We've known for awhile.  It doesn't make you any smarter than anyone else.  Of course, our beloved professor immediately brings up Hitler.  

>""It became illegal to be associated with the Communist party. ""

I'm not a fan of commies.  Not a fan of Nazis, either.  I think the government needs eyeballs on anyone associated with either of these political philosophies.  What about you?

>Declaring the loose concept of being against Fascism to be terrorism is like what Hitler, did but skips several of the steps. We all know how it ends. We aren't even starting in February. We are starting in March.

Trump isn't declaring the philosophy of ""being against fascism"" against the law.  If he was...most of our politicians would go to jail.  Because I can't think of any declared ""fascist"" among them.  Opposing communism isn't fascism.  It's common sense.

>This man can't be allowed to stay in office. If he does. If this movement loses momentum. The people of the United States aren't the only ones who lose. Everyone loses. The world loses. 

(Our OP is going to make it clear later that he is calling for us to get rid of Trump *by any means*...)

>Get out there. Get angry. Don't back down. For all our sakes. Please, don't back down.

(We have riots happening.  This ""professor"" who spells center ""centre"" later on is egging on these riots.  Why is reddit allowing a foreigner to encourage rioting in the USA?)

>Nixon resigned under protests, Mubarak was listed in Egypt after the Arab Spring, Marie Antoinette was beheaded and Mussolini was strung up by protestors at a gas station.

>There's more than one way to skin a cat. Vote, but be ready when the election is an inevitable sham.

#This is **inexcusable** reddit.  

#Ban this subreddit, already.  This foreign professor is encouraging violent revolution and encouraging killing our President.  ENOUGH REDDIT!

This is bad...yeah? But the comments DEVOLVE all of this further.  I will put the shots of ALL the comments at the end of the post, but let's just look at SOME of them.

[""We are all Jacobins when the last moderate falls. Revolution or death."" ""haha guillotine go zoom"".](https://imgur.com/a/YbfmvHB)

#It was called the ""Reign of Terror"" for a reason.  So when you are invoking it, don't be surprised when we all call you terrorists...

[Fight fascism with people's war!  Elections no!  People's war yes!](https://imgur.com/a/TzGUnM8)

This is a declaration of civil war.  And it's upvoted!

[Here's where they say that they are ""good"" with Stalin.  Making common cause with Stalinists is fine and, in fact, if you criticize Stalinists on the antifa subreddit your comment will be removed because you are ""causing leftist infighting.""](https://imgur.com/a/0KrsZ4t)

[""Biden is not anti-fascism.""](https://imgur.com/a/wZvpx5Z)

These people will not even be satisfied if Biden wins.  Do you understand yet?  It's not TRUMP that they oppose at all.  They oppose capitalism.  They are upset that Biden's campaign doesn't embrace socialism.  These are not anti-fascists...these are violent left-wing revolutionaries and they are announcing as much while also pretending to be offended that the nation has noticed.

[RED FOREVER!  STAY STRONG COMRADES!](https://imgur.com/a/RMUuSzo)

You think this is a larp, but that account has a three year history of posting lefty shit on reddit.

[This is very important.  Here is our OP noting that Trump was ""taken to a bunker"" and saying that he's NOT ""talking about voting.""  Our OP...is encouraging the masses to take out Trump...and if this isn't getting dodgy enough...](https://imgur.com/a/IB56SUk)

[Another poster says, ""Assassination is always an option...""](https://imgur.com/a/PAA0W2K)

This comment is still there and has been up for two hours now.

#So reddit, are you good with all of this?  Having the antifa subreddit feature a post that calls for civil war, killing the President, overthrowing the government and uniting Stalinists with the rest of the left to form a new revolutionary government that will use guillotines?

God help us.

I chose him because I wanted a Catholic sidebar going into Palm Sunday (a.k.a. Passion Sunday, for the Gospel reading) and Holy Week and because he says brilliant things about relativism and how dumb it is. I figured that the subreddit of interest would be appropriate, as well.

I  am personally very in favor of police and prison reform, and while i  understand that many conservatives are usually skeptical of these things, I do believe  that, personally, Trump's actions in these respects are some of the  best aspects of his presidency and that the driving force of BLM is  almost entirely fueled by gas lighting by the media.

I  am also  not saying that trump is the bulwark of prison reform or police reform,  or in anyway better than Jo Jorgensen or even Howie Hawkins. He could by  all  means do a lot more. What I am saying is that when you look at  their  voting history and actions, trump is objectively *FAAARRR* better than Biden on these two issues.

I   also don't give a fuck what the two candidates say, the rhetoric they  spread, or what the pinky promises they give to the press. I care about  their voting history and what they have actually done. Nothing more,  nothing less.

**Now lets get into the actual arguments.**

# Prison Reform.

# Biden signed the crime bill.

Most people here know this at least, but don't know EXACTLY what it did, and the dozens of other bills he signed what they did. *Biden played a HUGE role in the existence of the war on drugs and mass incarceration.*

***Every Major and Minor crime bill since 1976 has had the name of Joe Biden in it, either as an author, sponsor or co-sponsor***[.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html)

One of which was the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986)

it....

* substantially increased the number of drug offenses with mandatory minimum sentences.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEReamer2005134-10)
   * mandated   a minimum sentence of 5 years without parole for possession of 5   grams  of crack cocaine while it mandated the same for possession of 500    grams of powder cocaine, creating the racial punishment discrepancy   between crack and powder cocaine.
* increased the average time imprisoned for drug crimes from 22 months to 33 months.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1986#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShewan201389f-13)

His later calls for a ""drug czar""，a government official that oversaw all anti-drug operations, layed out the foundation for the **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988** which...

* allowed for mandatory minimums for drugs besides crack cocaine
* made   possession of more than five grams of a mixture or substance    containing cocaine base punishable by at least five years in prison[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Drug_Abuse_Act_of_1988)

He also played a key role in the signing of the [**Crime Control Act**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Crime_Control_Act_of_1984) **of 1984**[,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html) whose constituent parts includes but is not limited to...

* The  [Armed Career Criminal Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act) which....
   * made   it so that  If a felon has three or more prior convictions for  offenses  that are ""violent felony"" offenses or ""serious drug offenses,""[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Career_Criminal_Act#cite_note-2) they must serve a minimum sentence of fifteen years in prison.
* The  [Sentencing Reform Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_Reform_Act) which abolished federal parole for the vast majority of inmates.

The act itself also

* increased  federal penalties for cultivation, possession, or transfer of marijuana
* dramatically [**expanded**](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-18-me-24209-story.html)   civil forfeiture, which allows for law enforcement officers to take   assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal   activity without due process.

Joe Biden was a major sponsor of the [**Reducing American's Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_Americans%27_Vulnerability_to_Ecstasy_Act)

Its goal was to

* “prohibit   an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining,  managing,   controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or  profiting   from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing,  or using   any controlled substance, and for other purpose""

and to do so, it...

* created   the federal government crack house statute which heavily prosecuted   anyone who owned a property that was used for ""the purpose of   manufacturing, distributing or using any controlled substance”
* created   a civil penalty of $250,000 or ""2 times the gross receipts, either   known or estimated, that were  derived from each violation that is   attributable to the person,"" **which ever is greater.**

**he has also been against decriminalization of marijuana for 76 of the 77 years of his life, but again, actions not words.**

# And for the Flagship of all his crime Bills, ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, The 1994 Crime Bill itself[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_Crime_Control_and_Law_Enforcement_Act)

Joe Biden and racial segregate, Storm Thrumond, drafted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.

Its many provisions included

* The **Federal Death Penalty Act**

1. It   originally increased the maximum sentence of 44 crimes to be   death-eligible. The classic duo edited the provision to include 53   crimes. After that, they edited the provision to include 60, which was   the version passed by congress
2. Layed the groundwork for the [Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiterrorism_and_Effective_Death_Penalty_Act_of_1996) after the Oklahoma City bombing.

* The **Elimination of higher education for inmates**
   * It overturned the [Higher Education Act of 1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Act_of_1965), allowing inmates to receive a pell grant while incarcerated.
   * It   Effectively eliminated the ability of lower-income prison inmates to   receive college educations during their term of imprisonment,   dramatically increasing rates of recidivism and the ability for reform   after prison time
   * too be fair, Obama in 2013 introduced the REAL Act, which partly revoked this provision for certain, specific prisoners.
* The **Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.**
   * It   provided grants and fiscal insensitive for states whose prisons that   enforced mandatory sentencing of 85% of a person's sentence conviction
* Federal Assault Weapons Ban
   * banned the manufacturing of 19 firearms and temporally outlawed magazines and pistol grips.
* **Other Provisions**
   * initiated ""boot camps"" for delinquent minors.
   * Added fifty new federal offenses, including membership in a gang which violated our freedom of association
   * banned a vast majority of convicted felons from working in the insurance industry.
   * Introduced the Three-strike provision for repeat offenders, which **significantly**   increased the prison sentences of previous offenders and limited the   ability of these offenders to receive a punishment other than a life   sentence.
   * authorized the hiring of 100,00 more police officers

I  find it truly ironic that BLM protests and riots against over policing  and harsh criminal justice systems, so they pick a candidate that almost  single-handedly caused those things in the first place.

*But I hear you. I hear you.*

I hear the [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) brigadiers on this sub.

""Biden isn't 100% perfect, obviously, but he is the lesser evil on this issue.""

# Ok, lets compare the lesser evil.

*The   Trump. The Dumpf. The narcissist. The racist. The white supremacist.   The fascist. The antithesis of liberty. The ""literally Hitler.""*

Must be locking up black people willy nilly huh? Sure, whatever you say.

Trump  has been President for 3 1/2 years, and frankly, he could have  technically done nothing for police reform in order to beat Biden in  this regard, but thankfully for the American people, he hasn't done  nothing. In fact, relatively speaking, hes done a lot for prison reform.

**Yeah, donald dumpf and police reform in the same sentence. Fuck you.**

He signed The Fair Chance Act[.](https://reason.com/2019/12/20/trump-will-sign-federal-ban-the-box-bill-into-law-as-part-of-massive-spending-bill/)

* This   historic bill aimed at removing the check box that asks if applicants   have a criminal record from hiring applications，allowing ex- convicts  to  rejoin society and hold down a job without having their lives ruined
* It   enabled ex-offenders to display their qualifications in the hiring   process before being asked about their criminal records, making it much   easier for an offender to find and hold a job
* It would lower barriers to entry for nearly 60 million Americans with criminal records.

He signed the first Step act into Law[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act)

1. It   directs the Director of Bureau of Prisons to perform an initial risk   and needs assessment of all federal prisoners within 180 days of the   Attorney General's release of the risk and needs assessment system, and   to begin expanding recidivism-reduction activities allowing for   specialized reform spending and resources towards individual offenders   to maximize reform.
2. **increased the number of good-time credits** (yes, that is the actual name of the credit) per year—small sentenced reductions earned by prisoners for good behavior—**from 47 to 54.**
3. retroactively applied the good-time credits, **making some prisoners  immediately eligible for release** based on accrual of the seven additional  good-time credits per year.
4. prohibited the use of restraints on prisoners during pregnancy, labor and postpartum recovery
5. redefined    “serious drug felony” and “serious violent felony"" as different  terms,  which reduced the mandatory minimum sentence for a **second   drug violation from 20 years to 15 years, and reduced the mandatory   minimum sentence for a third violation from life to 25 years**
   1. it **reversed much of the mandatory minimums Biden signed into law**. Decreasing many of them from 5-10 years for non-violent offenders.
   2. It **Expanded eligibility for receiving below the mandatory minimum.**
6. Prison   administrators would use the national risk and needs assessment system   to classify a prisoner's risk of recidivism, to make decisions about   which recidivism reduction programs might be appropriate for each   individual, and to determine when a prisoner is prepared to transfer   into release custody.
7. Applies the [Fair Sentencing Act of 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Sentencing_Act), which **reduces the discrepancy between sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine convictions**, allowing for prisoners who committed offenses covered by the act to **IMMEDIATELY** petition a count to reconsider their sentence.
8. It expanded compassionate release (also ""reduction in sentencing"" or ""RIS"") for terminally ill patients
9. It reauthorized the[ Second Chance Act of 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Chance_Act_(2007)), which **gave   grants to states that support the successful reentry of juvenile and   adult prisoner populations into their communities after incarceration**
10. encouraged home confinement for low risk prisoners
11. **mandated de-escalation training** for correctional officers and employees

Could   he do more？Sure. Absolutely. Would Tim Scott have done a lot more?   Obviously. But is this magnitudes more than Biden has ever accomplished   in terms of prison reform in his 47 years in the senate? Yes.   Absolutely.

These 2 acts, on their own, were a **big fucking deal**.  So is should reason that anti-mass-incarceration and anti-war on drugs  libertarians and leftists should be celebrating these deals front and  back.

Except they don't, obviously. They only want prison reform when it comes from the candidate they like

# Police Reform

# Lame Duck Biden

Unlike   the first half, where i spent most of it shitting on Biden for mass   incarceration, there isn't too much to shit on here. This is because, in   his 47 years as a senator, the amount of police reform bills hes   written, signed, sponsored or at the very least, vaguely supported were **ZERO.**

However, the Obama administration did do several things for police reform, much of it was largely ineffectual.

For   example, the task force on 21st century policy did a large report that   suggested to police agencies recommendations that libertarians have  been  calling for for years. These included too many suggestions to  count,  but they broadly called for

1. increased training and education for officers
2. community policing
3. Increased oversight and accountability

After   the report ordered by Obama was created, 9 police enforcement agencies   adopted many of their recommendations. 9 whole agencies were heavily   reformed through Obama's direct action, compared to the 17000 law   enforcement agencies that are currently in the US.

Don't   get me wrong, any reform any where is good and should be celebrated,   but recommendations from the federal government that other governments  should be less corrupt don't usually do a whole lot.

What  is more significant were the many consent decrees he signed which gave  the federal government the ability to broadly overhaul a local police   department under the supervision of a federal judge. And while I am  weary of federal expansionary powers like this, I won't deny the impact  that they had in reforming the precincts they targeted.

However,   The vice president didn't do these things. Obama did. In fact, the  vice president has very little control over what the  president does.  These accomplishments can not be attributed, in any regard, to biden.

If  this was a fight between trump and Obama, I would have a much harder   time making the case i presented in the beginning. However, this is a   fight against Biden and Trump, which is a much easier claim to argue.   Again, Biden had 39 years in the senate to propose a single bill. Not   only did he not propose a single bill, to my knowledge, he didn't   sponsor or co-sponsor a single bill for police reform.

**Does BLM really think that he has had a complete change of heart since then?**

So, what has trump done for police reform?

Well, technically, much less than Obama, but its a much more complicated story than that.

Executive order on safe policing for safe communities[.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-safe-policing-safe-communities/)

3   months ago, to the partisan dismissal of leftists, Donald Trump signed   the Executive order on safe policing for safe communities

The executive order would have done the following.

1. It forced State and local law enforcement agencies to **constantly   assess and improve their practices and policies to ensure transparent,   safe, and accountable delivery of law enforcement services to their   communities.**
2. It made it so that the attorney general may only allocate funds to police agencies that have  **independent research credentialing bodies to keep the agency accountable.**
3. Made it so that the attorney general will have to appoint independent credential bodies that, at a minimum, **address and support policies and training regarding use–of-force and de-escalation techniques**; performance management tools, such as early warning systems that help to identify officers who may require intervention.
4. **Prohibited the use of choke holds** unless absolutely necessary
5. **Created a federal database of police misconduct** to be shared with federal, local and state agencies，**effectively eliminating the loophole in which fired police officers can relocate to a different precinct.**
6. identified   and developed opportunities to train law enforcement officers with   respect to encounters with individuals suffering from impaired mental   health and homelessness
7. increased the capacity of **social workers working directly with law enforcement agencies**
8. provided guidance regarding the development and **implementation of co-responder programs,**   which involve social workers or other mental health professionals   working alongside law enforcement officers so that they arrive and   address situations together.

This was an executive order signed in response to the massive BLM protests, obviously.

When compared to Obama's response to the protests **(heavily recommending certain actions for agencies)\*\*\*\*,**   Trump's response was extremely powerful. If implemented, it would have   gone on its way to solve 80-90% of the systemic corruption problems  within the police. If this bill was passed into law, trump would have  gone down in  history as having done more for police reform than, in my  opinion, every  president in the last 2 decades combined.

The  things in this order were the things being called for by BLM since the  inception of the movement. Trump proved that he was willing to actually  achieve  something about police reform in this country. Trump was in a  position  where he was able to make drastic changes to the problem of  police  corruption, and, unlike other presidents\*,\* he showed he was  willing to make those drastic changes.

>**I also think that it is worth mentioning the media's horrible, evil, coverage of this bill.** Most  of them didn't even report on it, but the ones that did, did so in a  purposely dishonest way to prevent police reform from being passed. [Stephan Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxTavjEu8Yc&t=455s)  gave the bill the most exposure, but they dismissed many parts of the  bill, like the federal database of police misconduct, calling it an  ""excel spreadsheet of the worst cops for trump to pick for his cabinet.""  He also conveniently forgot mention the massive corrupt loophole this  proposition would completely eliminate.  
>  
>He  also dismissed the increased amount of social workers working with  cops. He didn't really give a reason why, just said that ""it didn't  specify how close."" And dismissed increased funds for increased  training, which he has literally been called for by the vast majority of  police reform advocates, including Bernie sanders.  
>  
>He and [Trevor Noah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eynCAc_sHPY)  also pointed out the obvious loophole with ""banning choke holds unless  absolutely necessary,"" with the cop being able to lie on their report. ***Oh boy, if only there were an independent research credentialing bodies to keep the police agency accountable.***  
>  
>But  the most disgusting response of all, was when Colbert and Trevor Noah  said that because Trump refused to demonize the police undermine the  incredible work they do for society, that his attempts to prevent  individual instances of police corruption and abusive ""*didn't count*."" ***As if the two were mutually exclusive.***

Sadly,   because of the political party currently backing Joe Biden for   president, were probably going to have to wait a few more years for   that.

This police reform bill was   blocked. Blocked, not by the conservative, racist GOP, but by the BLM   loving Democratic party. People like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi   blocked this police reform bill from taking into effect and largely   ending the corrupt police they are so critical of.

The  Democratic Party blamed the Deaths of dozens of unarmed black men shot  by police on trump's inaction on police reform, yet, when trump  introduces legislature that very well could have prevented many of these  death, the DNC refused to support it. **Do you get it know BLM? Do you understand now?**

Not   only does Biden obviously not want police reform based on his record,   but the DNC also obviously doesn't want police reform. Its obvious they   only push it to gain more votes, and the second it would politically   hurt them to promote a bill for police reform like the one here , they  would change their position in a heartbeat.",Conservative,0

A message to all of the so-called conservatives celebrating the Supreme Court's striking down of DOMA.,7,1h4cay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/1h4cay/a_message_to_all_of_the_socalled_conservatives/,183,1372296601.0,"I've got news for anyone who thinks the Supreme Courts recent decisions favouring gay marriage are good:  

You're not a conservative.

You may be a good person, you may be smart, you even may be right on this issue, but you are not a conservative.

Marriage, in the Western tradition, has been between one man and one woman.  It is the core social institution of our society.  It shapes all aspects of our lives, and most importantly, it shapes how we perpetuate our society, through the bearing and raising of children.

The past 50 years have seen a radical change in a segment of our society's  sexual morality.  Marriage has become deprecated, as has the very notion of sexual morality itself.  Sexual expression has lost its natural allegiance with procreation.  Indeed, the only rule seems to be ""if it feels good, do it"".  Any action between consenting adults is permissible.  You condemn those that would hold to traditional sexual morality as depraved intolerants.  To refuse to celebrate institutionalized sodomy is to be an irrational bigot.

You have gone beyond Libertarianism, and embraced libertinism.

But for all the media propaganda, there remains a moral core of Americans, like myself, who believe that marriage can only be between a man and a woman and that any law that acknowledges otherwise embraces the vilest and most harmful perversity.

We may no longer be a majority, but we are still a plurality.  The wavering moderates are now siding with the sodomy crowd due to a very concerted propaganda campaign promoting institutionalized sodomy.  We are certainly guilty of losing the propaganda war.  Public opinion has swayed one way.  It can still sway back.  It's an ugly term, institutionalized sodomy, isn't it?  If you are a homosexual, it is the only way to consummate your marriage vows.

The legitimization of non-traditional marriage is a radical social change.  A conservative understands that government-mandated social change is a dangerous thing.  Let us not forget that the Supreme Court, by its actions, has through judicial activism struck down the express will of the people and their representatives.  DOMA was a law passed by Congress and signed by the President.  California's Proposition 8 was a direct plebiscite.  In its ruling against both of these, the Supreme Court has taken it upon itself to be an arbiter of morality over the will of the people.  This is repugnant to any believer in republican democracy -- to have a court of 9 tell a country of 300 million that they know better than we do as to what constitutes a legitimate marriage.

If you don't like DOMA, get Congress to repeal it.  If you don't like Proposition 8, get the citizens of California to repeal it.  Don't tell me you are a conservative because you think 5 judges should set the moral agenda for a nation.

This fight isn't over.  Those of us that believe in the inviolable sanctity of traditional marriage will continue to fight the popular fight against it.  We will not cede the Republican party to libertines.  And if the libertines take over the party, we will form our own party.

A conservative is not pleased when a slim majority of judges overturns centuries of common sense.  So congratulations on your ""victory"", just don't insult our intelligence by calling it a conservative victory.

The title is a statement from Rep. Allen West (R-FL) 

Is r/conservative so socially liberal that we abandon Christian values for those of the liberal elites? 

But how do you go about destroying society? Where do you direct the blow so it will do the most damage? In his Theses on Feuerbach, Karl Marx provided the answer: destroy the traditional family.

If they are allowed to marry and the government recognizes their marriages, then we will need to change what we teach our children in schools and tell them that when they reach the age of 18 they can marry either a man or a woman.

Legalizing gay “marriage” would leave society destroyed, because the family is the basic cell of society, and if I destroy the family or undermine it, I am destroying society.

With their tremendous, immense political clout, gays could easily attain matrimonial assets enjoyed by married couples (i.e., hospital visitations, inheritance issues, social security benefits, etc.) but that's not what this activism is about.

A note to Gary Johnson/Ron Paul supporters,6,12a5gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/12a5gp/a_note_to_gary_johnsonron_paul_supporters/,204,1351556989.0,"As a conservative republican, I want to appeal to those compelled to vote for Gary Johnson this election. Particularly those who feel more aligned with the conservative side of politics.

As I'm sure most of you are aware, this election is, to paraphrase Joe Biden, a big f'n deal. With that importance, every vote is going to count in swing states and in some instances, even states that are ""likely"" one way or the other. There are several states that are locks for either Romney or Obama, but many of us live in states that could very likely go either way. I happen to live in NH, an obvious swing state. But you may live in states like Oregon or Minnesota, states that could wind up being a toss up on election day.

To say that you're voting for Gary Johnson in this election is a throw away of a very important vote, in my opinion. I've been watching Johnson supporters on this subreddit give countless reasons why their vote for Gary Johnson is a good one. The bottom line is, it's not. It means nothing to the political process. And if you're a conservative leaning individual who's going to vote Johnson or write-in Paul, you're essentially giving Obama another vote.

Obviously we all have differences in our opinions. Is Mitt Romney the best possible choice for Republicans? No. I would've preferred Rubio or Christie as our first choice. Obviously you would've liked Gary Johnson or Ron Paul. But Mitt Romney is our candidate. And the goal here is to vote out president Obama. If I have to choose between Romney or Obama, I have to vote Romney. You should feel that way, too.

Gary Johnson knows he can't win, and he knows that running as an independent will likely take votes away from Romney. So why is he doing it? Likely for exposure for a run in 2016. Likely for the same reasons many of you are voting for him- because you just don't like the other two candidates. But remember, the only one you're impacting is Romney. Obama won't get the message because he'll get the support he needs from his base to win. So in the end, with your Johnson vote, you're voting in the guy you like **the least.**

My hope, as a conservative, is that all of us conservatives, in all our variations, can stand shoulder to shoulder in opposition of the democrat agenda. I don't know about you, but I fear what another four years of Obama would look like. And I was lucky enough to have a job throughout his presidency. But I know plenty of people who don't, and haven't had luck with many opportunities. I fear for them. And the millions of others who work at companies that are just getting by, or who are starting to slip. It's a dreadful situation for too many of us out there. Obama had his chance to fix it but he couldn't. Now it's time to give Romney a chance.

In 2000 we were 560+ votes away from an Al Gore presidency. This election can be that tight. Don't waste your vote away on Gary Johnson. Don't lose your voice at a time when we all need to be heard. There's too much riding on this one to be ignored. As a conservative, I hope you're with Mitt on this election day. Thanks for reading.",Conservative,0

Why SJW Crybabies are wrong about “Baby it’s Cold Outside”,36,a5ujvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/a5ujvz/why_sjw_crybabies_are_wrong_about_baby_its_cold/,72,1544744275.0,"First, let’s begin by looking at the lyrics.  Any discussion about the song must begin with an understanding of what’s actually going on.

_________________________________________________________

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside

I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside

This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in

So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry?

Father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar

So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry

Maybe just a half a drink more - Put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there

Say, what's in this drink? - No cabs to be had out there

I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now

To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell

I ought to say no, no, no - Mind if I move in closer?

At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride?

I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out

Ah, but it's cold outside


I've got to get home - Oh, baby, you'll freeze out there

Say, lend me your coat - It's up to your knees out there

You've really been grand - Thrill when you touch my hand

Why don't you see - How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Think of my life long sorrow

At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died

I really can't stay - Get over that hold out

Ah, but it's cold outside

Oh, baby, it's cold outside

Oh, baby, it's cold outside

_____________________________________________________

There are a few things that have to be understood:

First, the woman in song has never said no.  This cannot be overstated: she said that she ought to say no, but at no point has she made it clear that she wanted to stop.  It’s important to know that although she’s using “can’t” and “shouldn’t,” she has made no determination to stop the interaction, leave, or otherwise end the night.

Second, this woman is indecisive, but she’s leaning towards staying.  She’s playing hard to get a little, and she’s clearly wanting to stay with the guy.  She’s giving excuses, but she herself isn’t trying stand her ground.  She’s trying to feel good about her probable decision to stay.  Is this a statement about women in general?  Of course not.  This is a small scene between one man and one woman.

Third, there is no force or even explicit pressure from the man.  There’s implication, there’s a bit of seduction (of the 1940s style), but there’s nothing more.  Her arguments, though potentially valid, are almost all social in nature; his responses are personal and practical in nature.

Finally, the resolution (of a sort) is never stated.  By stating that it’s a song about date rape, SJWs are extrapolating well beyond what the song says.  Also, SJWs are applying their own views and notions to the language of the 1940s.  That would be like blaming Dwight Eisenhower for not using supersonic jet planes in WWII.  SJWs are merely assuming that the evening ends with sex and that she never wanted it, even though the song never says so.  The song is implicative on purpose. It draws images in people’s minds because there is so much that the song does not say.

Let me finish by saying that I do not like, and never have liked, this song.  I don’t like the implicative nature, and I am not comfortable with “sexy” Christmas songs.  The notion of Christmas is important enough not to cheapen with such nonsense.  I’ve never called for the song to be pulled off the radio and I’ve never complained publicly: I just don’t listen to it.

**EDIT**

I was recently accused of being a liar and not putting in lyrics to my own advantage.  I don't like being called a liar, and as evidence of at least my innocence of copying and pasting lyrics *as they were*, if not copying the best version, I am submitting a link to the website from which I got the lyrics. 

https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/shehim/babyitscoldoutside.html

Again, I am not here to base my arguments on lies. I did not look at any other lyrics websites.  Perhaps there are other versions of the song sung which make it out the woman gives a hard no, but this one didn't, and I have no memory from my youth a hard no being in there.  I claim ignorance in such matters, but I forcefully denounce the idea that I lied.",Conservative,0

Long time conservative liberal here. The Marxist Democratic agendas are getting out of hand. The fact they are going to take down Teddy FREAKING Roosevelt’s Statue drove me back to reality.,1783,hdiup5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/hdiup5/long_time_conservative_liberal_here_the_marxist/,503,1592818734.0,"I realized that the Democratic institution is a wolf in sheep’s clothing after 10 years. I used to be an absurdly left person who was also trying to figure out my gender identity. I also was calling for forced equality (due to myself identifying as a Bisexual at the time and had very, very Egalitarian views). I was not listening to my conservative friends how my views were toxic and actually FORCING people to accept equality and also FORCING people to accept my views and my views only. 

What the fuck was I thinking? Democrats are basically making people accept an ideology that’s really 1% of the population and a very vocal one for sure with deep  fucking pockets. Look at the fucking example of how the Left wants to take down Teddy Roosevelt’s state in front of a NYC museum. It’s ridiculous. What’s next? FDR? George Washington? Thomas Jefferson? 

I don’t see Asians (I’m asian) complaining about FDR how he forced Japanese Americans into intern camps am I? I hate the fact that they did so, but we have to understand history and why they did it. If it was the Australians who bombed Pearl Harbor, I am sure that FDR would’ve done the same to the Australians.

Also, yeah, we going to get rid of Thomas Jefferson’s achievements too since he owned slaves? Yeah, let’s also bomb Mt. Rushmore cause why not. They not POC. Ridiculous. 

Also, recently, after many years of therapy, had a realization that my bisexual tendencies were something of a mental illness. You see I was abused as a kid by my church. (Still am a Christian, but distrustful of people, cause people are at fault, not the church) Most of the gays know this btw. Many of us will not admit it. We know being gay, bi, or lesbian isn’t the natural order of things and it’s a mental illness tied with childhood trauma and development. 

This shit that is happening is basic takeover of Communists and I will not allow the USA turning into a free for all dystopia. I will be voting for Trump. Not voting for a child rapist either. Fuck Biden. 

Also, I’m sorry for not listening.

Edit: Also, I am not really for wealth distribution, I’ll just be straight and honest with you all. I’m wealthy and it’s my hard earned cash. My dad was an immigrant and through him and his hard work to send me to college and receive a great education, I achieved the American Dream. The Manifest Destiny. I am very economically right.

Why conservatives should NOT drop the social cons off and accept abortion,0,174ick,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conservative/comments/174ick/why_conservatives_should_not_drop_the_social_cons/,117,1358983295.0,"""If the right to life is an inherent and inalienable right, it must surely obtain wherever human life exists. No one can deny that the unborn child is a distinct being, that it is human, and that it is alive. It is unjust, therefore, to deprive the unborn child of its fundamental right to life on the basis of its age, size, or condition of dependency."" Mother Theresa  

To say that a mother's body trumps that of the unborn child is a denial of natural biological reproductive function, and denies the child the right to Life he so deserves. ""Reproductive rights"" are therefore false right's granted to a tyrannical sovereignty to be used to snuff the life out of those that are weaker, smaller, or more dependent than others. Just as a tyrannical leader does not have the right to put innocent lives to death, no too, should those with child be allowed to punish him for simply being the result of a purposefully designed biological function of called reproduction. 

To equate a fertilized egg as that of a clump of cells or to a virus is to ignore the fundamental differences between a clump of cells like that of skin or liver or a virus and the newly conceived baby, it's a scientific fact that a clump of skin cells does not grow up and become a separate individual nor does a virus. Again, to equate them as all the same is a form of willful ignorance.

As someone who analyzes data for a living, I am exposed to this on a daily basis. Liberals seem to miss this basic point that correlation does not equal causation. 

As an example, just because the weather may be unnaturally hot for the last 3 years, and the amount of craft beer sales have as well, does not mean that the unnaturally hot climate is causing a craft beer surge. 

Time to bring back this logic to our country and the world!

Edit: there seems to be a big climate change discussion going on below. I didn't use the above example as a denial of climate change, I used it as a hyperbole. Now, that being said, there of course is climate change, the climate is always changing. The question that I have never seen undeniable proof of is the exact amount we, as humans, are contributing to its ""unnatural"" change. At the worst it's minimal, at the best it's insignificant from what I have researched, and many of the panels of the ""97% of climate change scientists"", are not a statistically significant number, and many of those on the panels didn't actually conduct the research. 

Edit 2: well, this has been an exciting 24 hours. Thank you all for your kind words (sarcasm). I learned a few lessons. 1. Don't Reddit drunk or hungover, because sarcasm doesn't translate. 2. Drunken rambling does not make coherent arguments. 3. R/conservative is surprisingly liberal. 4. Over  -50 downvotes is a thing. And finally 5.

Anything Libya related seems to have more downvotes than upvotes, and even stuff that was very upvoted even last night has much worse ratios.

I know that reddit has an automatic downvote algorithm, but this is outside the norm. Is there anything that needs to, or can be done?

You claim that abortion and gay marriage are killing the republican party. 

That is not the problem. More people identify as Pro-Life, it's just our politicians are not doing a good job putting their position out. Akin is not intelligent. And Murdoch had his words twisted. It is not about rape it is about life. We need to better get this message across. 

As far as gay marriage goes, I believe marriage should be a religious only institution and the govt. Shouldn't be involved. Both candidates believed it should be left up to the states yet many people still believed Romney wanted to ban gay marriage. 

Immigration? How far are we going to go? It is obvious that if we go back in our laws we will gain more voters, but is that what we need? Do we go back on our values for votes? 

Women's rights? This issue isn't about women. It's about the government providing services for extra non necessities. 


The whole argument against Romney is that he only cares about the rich, wants to ban abortions, ban gay marriage, ban birth control, and how he hates illegals.

Stop falling back on your ideals in order to become more popular. Just get your message across better.",Conservative,0

Isn't trapping a guy under rubble (with no trial) where he dies slowly over days after having his arm blown off a little bit painful?

I am shocked by Reddit's new policy.

As a strong free speech advocate, I believe this has gone too far. I completely understand banning subreddits dedicated to hate, but banning a subreddit simply due to a few offensive individuals is absurd. However, what concerns me most about the policy is this: 

""While the rule on hate protects [marginalized or vulnerable] groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate."" 

Since when is so called ""hate speech"" limited only to marginalized groups? I understand that some groups are more vulnerable, but ALL groups can be targets of hate.

It's frustrating for me as an American to be witnessing the Republican party attempting to shift dramatically towards an anti-war pro-whistleblower party with a consistent small-government message who reaches to the political center, but progressives hyperfocus on single social issues, something that conservatives ARE SEEN TO BE GUILTY OF. We couldn't have asked for a better Trojan horse in anyone else than Ron Paul, not in the sense that he is the perfect leader, but rather his voice serves to be the perfect foil in a sea of noise to help guide the overall mainstream narrative that is the American story. I hope Ron Paul wins the nomination because this country would benefit from a series of debates between Obama and Paul better than any other scenario. Please join me, not as an Occupier, Tea Partier, Republican or Democrat, but as an American, in pushing for Ron Paul to win the Republican nomination for an exciting 2012 election season that regardless of who wins, We The People will have everything to gain if Paul becomes the voice of the Republican party. http://www.bluerepublican.org/",Progressive,0

But we're here because of the politicized nature of the SCOTUS. The highest court in the land should not be used as a political tool. But that is exactly what it has become. I'm beginning to think that the only way to fix it is by burning down the house. Let the GOP ram through a nominee. If Trump wins in November, oh well, he would be seating the nominee anyways. If Biden wins, he needs to pack the court by tying the number of seats to the number of appellate courts. The next trump could come in and pack the court even more, and so on, causing a runaway effect. Or, Congress on both sides decides the extreme bipartisanship is getting out of control and actually pass a reform that everyone agrees to.",Progressive,0

Anyone else noticing this breed of intolerance within progressive communities? What are your experience with it?,1,3bf9xd,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3bf9xd/anyone_else_noticing_this_breed_of_intolerance/,8,1435544829.0,"For me, I like to think I am an open minded/progressive thinker, yet a lot of my colleagues in the name of tolerance, forward thinking and acceptance for all are actually becoming very intolerant of people with (even slight) difference of opinions. Almost as if the whole progressiveness is just a gimmick for moral high-ground. In the name of political correctness, its like context does not matter... as soon as race, gender or ethnicity is involved, if you are not saying the same things as they are indoctrinated to believe... they will throw words at you like bigot, racist, sexist and etc.


Take for instance, #cancelcolbert. where a satirical joke (which is making fun of how racist a name like redskins for a NFL team) is blown out of context when Steven Colbert makes fun of bigots supporting it by saying ""I am willing to show #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever"" . The joke was to show a parallel that would seem outrageously offensive like the redskins should be to Americans... and the progressive community attacks Colbert as if he is the racist.  It gets so ridiculous that the woman who started it, when disucssing it in this video... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNK-e6nnFGY
tells Josh that as a white male in america, he has no right to say anything on the subject matter because ...you know white privilege. Belittling the white man's intelligence and brushing it off, to which Josh of course does not respond to well and belittles her and all the sudden it is all Josh's fault and the conversation ends. Really interesting...


Now i am from a Muslim descent, progressive thinkers love to defend my people and call any who just criticize the doctrine of Islam as bigots/islamphobes. Never mind the bigots for a second but even people who are discussing the danger that lurks in Islamic doctrine. Which is sweet of white liberals to do, thank you for defending my people... i guess. But these same people mock Christianity with no end... Almost a double standard, even though I agree there is an Islamist problems stemming out of, not just politics but, religion itself. This does not mean Muslims are bad, my mom is a devout Muslim and a very kind and generous person, the polar opposite of what ISIS is. But i would be a fool in to thinking that ISIS is not justifying its warmongery via Islamic texts. That is what the whole issue with Sam Harris and Ben Afflick on Real Time With Bill Maher was about. Again Ben being the progressive, not allowing any kind of ideas outside of progressive PC brand to even be expressed without getting zealot about his own position. Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vln9D81eO60 


Transgender is also interesting, not Catliyn Jenner, I support the idea behind it, sure do what ever you like but I do not see how that family (Kardasians) has any value to society for me to even care. I will say it seems weird, sure, can i have that opinion without being attacked? However to these kinds of progressives, It seems like another ploy to just sit around, see who has a bigoted (a.k.a not praising her) opinion and attack them. However the transgender Issue i want to bring up isn't even Catliyn. The example I want to direct in this conversation is about Fallon Fox. For those who do not know, she was a male MMA fighter(cage fighter), who decided to have a sex change and now fights woman. Can we have a conversation about this? All of the sudden anyone who says no to her fighting woman (i.e. UFC not supporting her and not allowing her to fight woman) gets criticized for being bigots. Here is the interesting fact, Fallon Fox, as a man was a terrible fighter, as soon as she had her sex change, started utterly dominating woman in her division. 
Her last opponent that she destroyed in 40 seconds said this ""’I've fought a lot of women and have never felt the strength that I felt in a fight as I did that night. I can’t answer whether it’s because she was born a man or not because I’m not a doctor. I can only say, I’ve never felt so overpowered ever in my life and I am an abnormally strong female in my own right,” she stated. “Her grip was different, I could usually move around in the clinch against other females but couldn’t move at all in Fox’s clinch…"" Link: http://www.cagepotato.com/after-being-tkod-by-fallon-fox-tamikka-brents-says-transgender-fighters-in-mma-just-isnt-fair/
But progressives who see the issue from a surface level, say well its okay for her to do this, she is a woman now and if you disagree or even want a discussion on the subject, you are a disgusting bigot. Even Joe Rogan who is a very progressive thinker is getting attacked by the far left.


Of course this all stems from stupidity not progressive thinking more so than anything else because its about moral high-ground... not understanding the deeper conversations. One class on racism in college is enough to shoot these kinds of people off on their journey. My own anecdote that got me writing...Today, I referred to my friends as ""brothers"" who happened to be black and the white girl started ranting on how I can not say brother, its exclusively allowed in the black community among each other.. I had to explain to her my brother was referring to how deep me and my friends relationship is. I was not mocking them by saying ""brothas"". Then i started wondering IF i say the word ""my niggas"" which, also among people who are not nuts, means a very close bond... I wonder how much her moral high ground duty would have sky rocketed then. Even though I freely use that word with my black friends. 

What do you guys think about this ""far left"" movement?  Any stories on the subject you can share whether its anecdotal or something you read on the internet/media?",Progressive,0

Martin O'Malley 2016,0,33yroq,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/33yroq/martin_omalley_2016/,3,1430116165.0,"(I'm re-posting this in order to help spread the word of Martin O'Malley) 

Martin O'Malley is possibly the best option for president America currently has. O'Malley has served as an executive for 15 years. First as the mayor of Baltimore, then as the Governor of Maryland. And now, he is looking at a possible presidential run.

Martin O'Malley has been a proven endorser of progressive issues for a long time. As Governor he passed things such as a Marriage Equality Act, He increased the minimum wage to $10.10, he passed a Gun Law that made it harder for guns to get into the wrong hands, and he ended the Death Penalty. Those are some very big accomplishments. But possibly more impressive, is the following. As the Governor of Maryland, O'Malley maintained a AAA Bond rating throughout the recession for his state (one of only seven states to do so). Education Week magazine ranked Maryland’s public schools #1 in America for five years in a row, and Maryland has ranked #1 in AP performance for eight consecutive years, according to the College Board. Also Under Governor O’Malley, Maryland was ranked the best state for Women in America! According to the Center For American Progress, “on matters of economics, leadership, and health, women, on average, fared the best in Maryland.” And in the midst of the worst economic downturn in history, Governor O’Malley reformed Maryland’s income tax. Today, 86% of Marylanders pay less in state income taxes than they did before Governor O’Malley took office. Maryland also ranked #1 for innovation and entrepreneurship for three years in a row, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Now those are some real accomplishments. But those accomplishments didn't come free. Early on in his Governorship, O'Malley created a $1 tax on cigarettes, which went to healthcare so 300,000 people who didn't have healthcare could get it (that was before the affordable care act). He raised the corporate income tax by 1%. And one thing he did ask everyone in MD to do was pay one more cent on their sales tax, which made Maryland the 42nd lowest sales tax in the nation. And he created a progressive income tax, in which he asked the top 15% to pay more than the other 85%. All of these lead to those great accomplishments listed above.

All told, Martin O'Malley was an extremely successful Governor, with a great progressive resume. And thats why i'm spreading the word of Martin O'Malley 2016!",Progressive,0

We call them Libertarians in the U.S. We are progressives. 

Our view points are grounded in the ideal of equality whether it's marriage, the marketplace, education, healthcare, or the justice system. 

The term liberal is easily used against us when regressives chose to equate our system with that the National Socialists better known as the Nazis. It's a bullshit argument due to that fact that they were the complete opposite of liberals as well since they were a totalitarian government that controlled all facets of life but our (for a lack of better description) opponents are not always the brightest. Will they still be opposed to our core values if we stopping using incorrect terminology? Sure, they are conservatives which indicates they don't want change unless it restores the previous rights that have been allocated to the rest of the population. 

As progressives, we understand education is the key to better the world around us. We must be open to changing paradigms that don't fit our current views. If new data suggests they are more equitable ways to govern, we should flexible to embrace the change. As progressive, we understand that weak governments lead to very poor societies, culturally and financially. We also understand that every freedom requires an equal responsibility. If you want to own a gun, you should accept some responsibilities that come with them just like you want to drive a car, have a family or own a business. Our government is flawed and needs work but it's better than none or smaller ones (see WV, KS, LA). 

Liberal doesn't fit our moral system. Jesus wasn't a liberal, he was a progressive just like Buddha and other philosophers before him. The idea we should treat everyone around the same is not a liberal idea, it's progressive. If Jesus were liberal, he would argue that each person is indeed an island and should be allowed to do whatever he (or she) wants as long it doesn't impact anyone else. That's not what Jesus said. He said humans should sell their possessions (giving up economic freedom), feed those hungry (thinking of others above yourself), and don't judge others (maybe a little Libertarian). Liberals, by definition, are (lack of better word) self serving. They want to be able to run their business anyway they feel fit, to be allowed to do whatever they want, to discriminate against whoever they want.
We have r/progressive. I just ask that you think this over and if you feel progressive fits you better, join me there. I'm sure the moderators would welcome the moderators from here. Thank you for your consideration.",Progressive,0

Part of me is torn: I don't know whether to 1) defend the ACA by countering the crazy conservatives mindlessly criticizing the ACA with hypocrisy, nonsense, half-truths, and full lies, or whether I should 2) criticize it too, for being so close to the single most conservative health care reform plan proposed in the United States. 

Seriously, the political spectrum has shifted so much that the ****Democrats passed a law which, 20 years prior, was unthinkably, radically right wing.**** But everybody hailed it as a praiseworthy, moderate compromise, except the conservatives, who have forgotten that they came up with the idea, decrying it as liberal socialism on par with nazi fascist communism. 

Why should I defend the conservative plan which the conservatives are now attacking in their amnesia? 

Now, **fortunately, the conservatives at the Heritage Foundation came up with this plan back when political conservatism was still pragmatic, so it will actually be somewhat** (perhaps remarkably) **effective. But the individual mandate is utterly odious and should have been deemed unconstitutional.** My money is going to go to the insurance industry whether I buy insurance or not; When I am fined for not purchasing insurance from one of the several abominable companies offering me insurance plans, that fine money goes into their pockets anyway as compensation for my not buying a plan from them!

That fine is going to be 2.5% of an individual's income. Now, **I refuse to purchase health insurance from insurance companies out of moral principle.** *The same way someone might refuse to buy from Nike for using sweatshops,* refusing to buy bananas because of the oppressive nature of the industry, or buying local instead of shopping at walmart, **I do not wish to participate or contribute to the psychotic, anti-human health insurance industry of any of its scumbag companies.** *What if you were fined for refusing to purchase groceries from a major grocery store? Fined for refusing to drive a car?* 

How much better would it be if that 2.5% income tax went straight into a single payer system like a combo between the VA and medicare/medicaid? **But as it is, this is one of the most regressive taxes ever.** *It's more regressive than the flat tax.* The wealthy will be buying health insurance for far less than 2.5% of their income, whereas the poor and ""middle class"" will be either paying about that or more than 2.5% for their plans (or be paying the fine, but getting no benefit in return).

"Why medical costs will really skyrocket now: Under Obamacare all health insurance companies now want medical costs to rise as much as possible over time so their actual profits go up because they are all now ""cost plus' providers",0,3otkdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/3otkdg/why_medical_costs_will_really_skyrocket_now_under/,0,1444914632.0,"Why your medical costs will really skyrocket now.

Under Obamacare all health insurance companies now want medical costs to rise as much as possible over time so their actual profits go up because they are all now ""cost plus' providers.

Let me explain.

The health insuramce companies in the USA under obamacare or the Affordable Care Act are now allowed to charge only 25%-20% more in premiums than they pay out. This is called a MLR or Medical Loss Ratio.

 It was supposed to limit profits health insurance companies made. 

 Instead it turns them all into ""cost plus"" contractors who all now WANT healthcare costs to rise as much as possible over the years so they can charge you higher premiums so that 20% profit is a lot more real money.

(I am amazed this isnt discussed all the time. I have NEVER heard it discussed. I don't think the providers or the health insurers WANT it discussed. would you?).

  As a result in order to make their profits higher health carecosts must be HIGHER. So health insurance companies are all now ""cost plus"" companies and want health care costs to be as high as possible. If average hospital costs per appendectomy rise 50% next year  then health insurance companies  will ne able to charge premiums 50% higher and their 20% profit margin will be much much higher in total dollar profits.

So ironically the health insurance companies  that used to try to keep health care costs down now ALSO want them to rise as much as possible over the years. Theymight lose a little more this year but next year they make a LOT more. And of course hospital companies and providers want to  raise them as much as possible. So now EVERYONE EXCEPT YOU THE PATIENT wants medical care costs to rise as much as possible.  

And because there is little competition between health insurance companies to keep your premiums low because now YOU MUST PURCHASE HEALTH INSURANCE BY LAW health insurance premiums are rising 40% and 50% per year. So guess what ? The health insurance companies will charge 20% on top of that increase and their profits will go much higher every year costs go up!  The6 would love it if every appendectomy in the USA cost $1 million dollars next year.

When your contract states you can charge a percentage of the cost its called a ""cost plus""contract. Suddenly you want all costs to be as high as possible. It is ""cost plus"" governent contracts in the defense industry that led to $500 hammers.  Now instead of hammers, its medical procedures which already start at $50,000 so you can imagine how bad this will be in a few years unless something is done.

No good business person EVER wants their providers to have cost plus contracts. EVER.

But that is in the past.

The question is how do we fix it?

You have probably experienced the total financial rape that the US medical esrablishment does because no one limits them.

In most countries the government limits what doctors and hospitals can charge by procedure. Since they know what tue average is they know what they should cost. This means all providers like hospitals have an incentive to figure out ways to deliver medicine cheaper because that is the only way they can increase profits. And they have to stay high quality or they are cut from the program completely and cant practice medicine at all.

In japan for example doctors and hospitals are limited by law how much they can charge. Docotrs for example can only chargeso much per stitch for cuts. As a result they must find ways to do things cheaper to make profit. As a result a Japan developed the least expensive MRI  machine inthe wordl which costs $2000 FOR THE WHOLE MACHINE NOT PER TREATMENT.  (That machine is of course banned in the usa.)

So we need to switch to government price limits quickly and our medical costs will come down. Insurance comaonies wont be happy of course becuase that means their 20%surcharg ewill be much smaller but you will be happier as your helath insurance costs fall.

The usa government already knows what procedures shpuld cost and limits them for medicare. If you have a parent on medicare you know how wonderful their treatment is and howsmotthly it all works. So this isnt hard to do. In  fact the us governme t already does it!

So we need to drastically change Obamacare . The easiest thing would be to allow everyone to go into the medicare program. Their premiums would be much lower .You dont have to reregulate the obamacare system becuase all patients would quickly abandon it.",Progressive,0

Is it a contradiction for many progressive to oppose the War on Drugs while supporting strict gun control measures?,1,33yj0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/33yj0k/is_it_a_contradiction_for_many_progressive_to/,7,1430111791.0,"According to many progressives today, the federal government is corrupt.  It is beholden to moneyed special interests and advances the interests of lobbyists.  It spies on its own citizens and foreign governments.  It perpetuates a serious mass incarceration problem.  It errs on the side of restricting civil liberties rather than protecting them.  So why do these same progressives think the federal government can be trusted to regulate gun ownership when similar efforts - namely, the War on Drugs - have been such massive failures?  Why do progressives still trust big government solutions to any problem, for the matter, if they acknowledge that the federal government has become so hopelessly corrupt?

I consider myself left-of-center politically.  I agree with progressives on many issues.  But when it comes to civil liberties, I think the libertarians are far more forceful and consistent.  Consider this:  Mexico has some of the toughest gun control laws in the world.  Has that made any difference whatsoever?",Progressive,0

"(throwaway) Progressives of Reddit, I'm finding myself increasingly racist/resentful of black people. I've always been open-minded and I'm actively looking for ways to change my perceptions. Hatred does not dwell well within me. Story inside.",0,1c86id,https://www.reddit.com/r/progressive/comments/1c86id/throwaway_progressives_of_reddit_im_finding/,5,1365825226.0,"Before I explain myself, do understand that any comments castigating me as a racist or insults in my direction will be of no use- I'm not proud of my feelings and I'm actively looking to change them. I've always considered myself an open-minded person- liberal even- grounded in science and academia (currently getting an application for med school in order).

I grew up in a predominantly white town in southern california- population around 120,000. Violent crime simply did not exist. No murders. No rapes. Life was good. In fact, my hometown was named America's safest city once when I was a young lad. My dad owns a lackluster shoe store. My mom is a receptionist at a dentist's office. We are pretty poor. Neither of my parents attended college. Nonetheless, I was lucky enough to attend an Ivy League school for undergrad (after 2 years at a community college) and I'm currently applying to some of the top med schools in the country. I share these facts to hopefully emphasize the point that I am not some rich white individual who was born with a golden spoon in my mouth. I worked exceedingly hard to get where I am today and I'm a pretty logical person.

Nonetheless, following my graduation from college I moved to Los Angeles. A shitty part of Los Angeles. This is where my resentment towards black individuals first began. Literally almost everyday I would get verbally abused by black individuals in the street. ""Look at this fucking white boy."" ""I'll fuck this nigga up."" ""Who da fuq are who? Fucking white boy."" Blah Blah Bla. These odd verbal attacks occurred as I simply minded my own business, just trying to get to my own apartment building. These random outbursts were 100% unprovoked each time. Even worse were the cat calls directed at my girlfriend. These people would say some of the grossest fucking shit I've ever heard. They would yell it from their cars sometimes. Black dick this... Fuck that ass that...Mmmm gurllll. If my girlfriend ever retorted, she would actually get called a racist by these people? This is still a concept that seems pretty fucking stupid to me.

In any case, after a few months in LA I finally got mugged by a black person. Knife point. Luckily I was alone (sans the girlfriend). Took $60 dollars from my wallet. Luckily he didn't realize I had my Iphone in my pocket/didn't want it.

At this point I was feeling pretty fucking shitty about where I was living but I didn't have the funds to move elsewhere and I liked the research position I had landed at USC far too much. Life went on this way for awhile. I started to notice black people on the streets everywhere I went around town. On Tuesday afternoons, for example, there would be groups of black men just crowding around alleys or someone's doorway. Always. I became attentive to other minorities- hispanics and asians- and these individuals typically seemed to be working somewhere. Black individuals, however, always seemed to just be hanging around neighborhoods. I began to notice differences for the first time.

5 months after my first mugging, my friend and I were mugged again by THREE black individuals. This time at gun point. Gun was at my friends head. Again, took both our wallets and our phones and my friend's watch.

I finally moved. This time I found myself in Chicago (I know- not exactly the safest city either). I was never mugged in Chicago but some of the shit I was while on public transportation blew my mind. It was ALWAYS caused by black people. The SMALLEST thing would set these people off like a fucking gallon of gasoline. The rage in these people on the bus, this apparent lack of self-control really affected my perceptions. I saw so many fights, so much pathetic gangster talk and so much bullshit.

I am currently still living in Chicago and the same shit goes on- I am often hollered at as I mind my own business- I still always see black people just hanging around during working hours. I still see girls constantly getting cat called on the bus/street.

In the past months I have started looking up things online- statistics, videos, articles etc. all detailing black crime. I'm sure I don't need to enlighten anyone but the numbers are fucking appalling. Blacks outnumber everyone in violent crime by such a significant margin it blows my mind. I know poverty is often cited as the explanatory variable here, but there are twice as many poor white individuals as poor black individuals in this country- without a fraction of the violent crime. The Atlanta PD recently put out stats citing that 95% of all rapes in the city were caused by blacks- although they make up 54% of the population. Numbers were equally as high for other types of crimes. Welfare recipients are overwhelmingly black. Even legitimate scientific articles in psychology (http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf) have mentioned that social factors do not account for the variance in some attributes of black individuals. I have seen some shit, Reddit, that paints the average black person in a horrible light- and i don't know how to un-see it. I recently spoke to my close friend currently in Paris and she tells me that the French are having their own terrible time with black people and individuals are growing increasingly aggravated about the black crime in that country. I've seen similar storys in London and Scandinavia.

Now, I know not ALL black people are like this, of course. My good friend from college was black (although adopted by white parents, oddly enough) and he was a fantastic and brilliant human being. I have met other black people with similarly sterling qualities. Yet, 95% of black people that I encounter fucking suck. I have come to fucking detest the gangster culture and I have realized that stereotypes are fucking realities.

I want to change my perceptions. I liked being my old liberal self. Hatred does not meld well within me. What can I do, Reddit?

I've always believed Americans should vote for whomever they like best--Republicans, Greens, whatever--because voting from fear isn't noble and it's contrary to our best interests in the long term. Moreover, even GOP candidates I've disagreed with have never seemed inherently dangerous. Most politicians--especially those running for president--have big egos, but most also are humans and seem like they like the country we call home.

But none of this is true anymore. It's clear to anyone who is objective that Trump is a liar and he's an egomaniac. These things combined make him dangerous, and when you factor in his ignorance of foreign and domestic policy, it's clear the only reason he's running is ... so he can say he's president. 

Look at this another way: I have posted in the past and told friends I believed Ted Cruz would be a more regressive president than Trump. I still believe this, and I believe it because Cruz has more or less stuck to the same basic conservative principals throughout his political. Meanwhile, it's obvious that Trump will say anything to anyone on any day and what he says will have little to do with what he's said in the past. His views change to the point of outright contradiction with alarming rapidity and the only thing we can be sure about is, he doesn't care about anything but winning for the sake of winning. 

In short, he is truly and deeply dangerous. He should not have been nominated but he cannot be president. This man is insane. 

So, please, if you live in Florida or Ohio or any other battleground state, please, please just vote for Hillary. ",Progressive,0

Especially now, with his signing of NDAA and his probable signing of SOPA into law, I began to think of alternatives, and one came to me.

If Ron Paul were to be elected, almost all of the things he would have any real and immediate control over would fall on the side of the liberal agenda. Drug enforcement, civil liberties, military actions in other countries,etc.

In addition, the guy doesn't play games. He follows a strict set of ethics and never deviates. Sometimes, that might mean something we don't like, buy at least we would know what we were getting into. With Obama, I'm severely in doubt of every word that leaves his mouth nowadays.
 
There is a small possibility of him being able to elect a supreme court justice; however, most of them are in good health and none of them (to my knowledge) have any plans of stepping down. 

Would it be so bad to have a Democratic House and Senate, with a libertarian as president?

I am a PhD student studying media portrayals of Latin America, and I can honestly say, Venezuela may be the most misrepresented country in the press. 

I don't want you to just believe me. I have given you links so you can scrutinize my argument fully. Check up on me. Am I making this stuff up or exaggerating? Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable sources of primary data, such as the World Bank, the United Nations and highly reputable polling organizations like Pew and Latinobarmetro, which is a Chilean polling organization whose work features regularly in the Economist, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Let's get mythbusting!

**The Accusation** Chavez led a coup. It is often remarked that Chavez led a coup in 1992. Two example is [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html) New York Times article and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/key-events-in-hugo-chavezs-rise-to-power-and-presidency-in-venezuela/2013/03/05/8a4dddcc-85e1-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html) Washington Post article. Conveniently, the context of the coup is left out. Despite producing more the $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, the equivalent of 20 Marshall Plans, the majority of Venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were  below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970 and 1997, workers' incomes declined by [50%, while poverty doubled between 1984 and 1991](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040274?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101776675521)

President Carlos Andres Perez, on orders from the IMF, increased oil prices for Venezuelans. This led to increases in transport costs, to the point where Caracas residents were spending, on average, 25% of their entire wages on bus fares.  (Jones, B. [“Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) p. 116) Food riots broke out and Perez sent the army in. 3 days of terror ensued. The LA Times' Bart Jones speaks of Red Cross workers being gunned down in the street, “mass graves” being filled with “mutilated corpses”, “tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of their heads” and children being gunned down as the armies fired indiscriminately into shanty towns. (Jones, B. [Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578797&sr=8-2&keywords=hugo+bart+jones) pp.121-124) Much of the army leadership was deeply shocked at this. They began to gather around a young Colonel called Hugo Chavez and conspired to rebel against the President. The rebellion of 1992 failed, and Chavez was sentenced to what amounted to a life sentence, yet, the rebellion was so popular with the public that the new president, Rafael Caldera was essentially forced to release Chavez just 2 years later. After getting out he immediately began to organize for a Presidential election.

**Myth: Partially confirmed**

Myth 2- The Venezuelan economy is a shambles. In [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-oil-giants-squeeze-chavez) Guardian article, the author wonder how long the Venezuelan economy can totter on. Figures from the World Bank, hardly a Chavez ally, show a different story. Venezuela's GDP has [more than tripled under Chavez,](http://i.imgur.com/CyeLEvC.jpg) while net national income [has also nearly tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/gKd5YBs.jpg) Meanwhile, both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment has dropped from over 11% to under 8%. When asked themselves, Venezuelans have the [highest confidence in their economy of any Latin American country.](http://i.imgur.com/QtZ7L3x.jpg) Venezuela's external debt has [dropped precipitously.](http://i.imgur.com/rJSNmaS.jpg) Meanwhile, Venezuela's stock market is the [best-performing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) in the [world.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) You may have heard stupid Chavez is causing massive inflation, [but the facts are the opposite](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg). One year before Chavez took office, inflation was an eye-watering 103%. It is now in the teens. The high-point inflation under Chavez was lower than the lowest inflation under the previous 2 presidents. 

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Chavez is a dictator**
This one is so ubiquitous I won't give examples. 

Voter turnout in Venezuela in the October 2012 election was above [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012), higher than any election in US history. Under Chavez, voter turnout in Venezuelan elections has increased by 135% (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout:[14.8 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012). That means almost two and a half times as many people vote nowadays than in the 1990s. The number of registered voter has risen by over 70% under Chavez.

Jimmy carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=74&jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, saying [“the system developed in Venezuela is probably the most advanced in the world to date”](http://embavenez-uk.org/pdf/fs_democracia.pdf) The number of polling stations has increased by [38% in 10 years.](http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf) One year pre-Chavez, only [11% of Venezuelans](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) believed elections were clean. By 2006, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuelans rate their democracy the [second best in Latin America](http://i.imgur.com/MWs264L.gif). Venezuela has by far the most politcal parties in Latin America, and confidence in them is the [highest in the region.](http://i.imgur.com/c7B0Me0.jpg) In 2002, [80%](http://i.imgur.com/6uRqNRB.jpg) of Venezuelans believe their vote influences policy. Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy from [1-10](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) How does Chavez do it, it must be because...

**Myth: Chavez Controls the Media** There appears to be an authoritarian dictator crushing freedom of the press in Venezuela. We read about it all the time. How many free outlets are left?

As Mark Weisbrot has shown in an extensive study, the Venezuelan state owns [about 5% of all media outlets.](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf) Both the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19368807) and [Le Monde](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) agree on the 5% figure. For comparison, state-owned media account for 40 and 37% of British and  French TV. 9 out of the top 10 selling newspapers in Venezuela are virulent anti-Chavez, and by virulent, Le Monde Diplo calls it [“hate media”](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) while Richard Gott in the Guardian says the largest station, RCTV is a [“white supremacist channel”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jun/07/comment.venezuela) and JMH Salas reports that they regularly assault him with words like [“sambo, thick-lipped monkey” “ape”](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040277?uid=3738032&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&sid=21101777011571) (Chavez is the first-non white President) In contrast to what we read, Venezuelans believe there's [about as much freedom of speech as there is in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg) **Myth: Busted**

**Myth: There are food shortages in Venezuela**

Actually, venezuela has [doubled the amount of cereals it produces](http://i.imgur.com/qPybLCY.jpg) in just 10 years, [as have milk, eggs and pork](http://imgur.com/agUo7ym). Child malnutrition has dropped by [2/3 in 10 years](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg), too. So, are there food shortages? Look at this [anti-Chavez blogger's post.](http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/food-shortages-in-venezuela.html) He shows that food shortages mean the most popular mayonnaise is gone, but there are clearly 4 or 5 other brands still available. Again, white sugar is gone but there is plenty of brown left. Only one brand of powdered milk is left. The reason for this is Chavez instituted price-controls and gave people jobs, increasing their purchasing power. This meant for the first time in their lives, ordinary people can afford dairy produce. If you think about the logic behind this, you can find out a lot about how the media see ordinary people. In the 1990s when children were dying from malnutrition, there were no stories of food shortages, but now that rich people like themselves can't find Kraft mayonnaise and have to settle for Hellmans, that is a shortage. **Myth: Busted**

**Myth:** Venezuela is the most dangerous place in the world

There can be no doubt that there are many murders in Venezuela, as this chart of [reported homicides shows.](http://i.imgur.com/0j1zklT.jpg). Those claiming crime was the country's major problem increased from less than [1% in 2001](http://imgur.com/2npBf1b) to [65% in 2010](http://imgur.com/kk2DuUN). And yet, when asked whether they or their family were victims of crime, “yes” dropped from [49% in 2000](http://i.imgur.com/SRufLZk.jpg) to [28% 2010](http://i.imgur.com/3u0luhO.jpg). Your chances of being a victim of crime have dropped by half while your fear of crime has spiked 6500%, which leads me to believe it is a media circus. Several writers have pointed to an orchestrated campaign by the media to focus on crime, and not the progress Venezuela has made. 

**Myth: Partially Busted**

**Myth Hugo Chavez is anti-semitic**

The entire case for this comes from a quote where Chavez spoke ill of “those who crucified Jesus”. When read in context, it cannot be taken as such. He gave a list of traitors. He mentioned those who doubled-crossed Simon Bolivar, those who crucified Jesus, those who betrayed Che Guevara, etc. [Here's a pic](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5645) of Chavez meeting the leading Rabbi in venezuela. I might add that this is common tactic of the US elite. A New York Times search for [“Nicaragua anti-semitism”](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/anti-semitism+nicaragua/) shows no hits for 130 years, a slew of stories between 1983-1986, when the left-wing Sandinistas were in charge, then nothing for 25 years.

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Hugo Chavez loves dictators like Saddam and Ahmadinejad .**

Most of the reports of this come from the time when Chavez went on a whistle-stop tour of the oil-producing countries. The day after he met Ahmadinejad, he actually met a dictator with a far worse human rights record. [That person was US-favorite, the King of Saudi Arabia.](http://www.images22.com/pics/04/saudi-arabias-king-abdullah-with-hugo-chavez.jpg) The picture elicited almost no response in the US media whatsoever. Chavez has taken a lead in reinvigorating the OPEC cartel, and his visits were laying the groundwork for an agreed reduction in oil drilling, in order to stabilize prices. 

**Myth: Busted**
**Myth: Chavez is an Isolated, Unpopular Leader**

Chavez was the first President of the [Pink Tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_tide), who see themselves as left-leaning, anti-imperialist politicians. President Lula of Brazil openly backed Chavez, saying [""A victory for Chávez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America … this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.""](www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy). President Correa of Ecuador has called Chavez “a guiding light”( Jones, B. “Hugo” p.420) [Here's a pic](http://paginadoenock.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kirchner-Evo-Lula-Chavez.jpg) of the Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina with Chavez, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/iaubmdb.jpg) what the Argentine public think of him. When asked which country they admired the most, Latin Americans chose [Venezuela by a considerable margin.](http://i.imgur.com/nOaLC5T.png)

**Myth: Busted**

**Bonus Myth: The People are worse off under Chavez**

Chavez instituted a national healthcare system which had performed 225 million consultations by 2007 alone. (Cannon, B.  Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93) The number of public doctors has increased by 1200%, from 1628 to 19571 by 2007. 50,000 Venezuelans were given free operations to restore their sight, between 1 and 1.5 million were taught to read for the first time (Jones p. 8) Health expenditure per person [has tripled](http://i.imgur.com/PriJgse.jpg) According to the Gini coefficient, venezuela went from the most unequal country in Latin America to the most equal. An AC Nielsen/Datos report showed that, from 2004-2006, [97.6% of the population grew in income.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2794)

As a student of Latin America, I think Venezuela is one of the most vibrant democracies on Earth, yet the media is representing it as a hellhole. Why is this? [Many](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/201312912275351687.html) have [wondered](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hugo-chavez-proves-you-can-lead-a-progressive-popular-government-that-says-no-to-neoliberalism-8202738.html) Some say it can be explained with [Chomsky and Hermann's Propaganda Model](http://southoftheborderdoc.com/media-distortions-in-latin-america/)

For me, I think it is because they're scared. Of you.  They're scared if people in America knew the truth about what can be achieved in a small country, there would be a dramatic change in American politics overnight. 


Venezuela is certainly not an ideal society by any means, and I'm not even much of a Chavez supporter, but it saddens me to see so many derogatory remarks made about someone who spearheaded change which the vast majority wanted. It also clouds real debate over his failings, as people like me are forced to spend their time correcting and replying to nonsense accusations.
